# DETECTION OF NEGATION AND UNCERTAINTY

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection of negation and uncertainty in text data. The model can be useful in various natural language processing (NLP) applications such as sentiment analysis, information extraction, and medical text analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a JSON file containing sample texts and annotations of negation and uncertainty provided by the company ASHO. The dataset is divided into two subsets: a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). Each text sample is annotated with the presence of negation and uncertainty, allowing for supervised learning.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `dataset/`: This directory contains the JSON dataset file.
- `src/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks and dataset used during the process.
- `experiment report/`: This directory contains the project report and the presentation.
- 'Final_Notebook.ipynb': This file contain all the code and explanations of the project.

## Installation and usage
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-repo.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook  'Final_Notebook'.

To use the trained models on new data, follow these steps after runnig the code:.
1. Preprocess the new text data using the same preprocessing steps used during training.
2. Feed the preprocessed data into the model for prediction.

## Results
The performance of the developed models was evaluated on the validation set. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are reported in the project final notebook.
