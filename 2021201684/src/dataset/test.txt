He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice.
At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions.
At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him.
Seven o'clock, already, he said to himself when the clock struck again, seven o'clock, and there is still a fog like this.
And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.
 But then he said to himself:
Before it strikes quarter past seven I will definitely have to have got properly out of bed.
And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what is happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock.
And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time.
If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.
His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.

From the room on his right, Gregor is sister whispered to him to let him know:
Gregor, the chief clerk is here.
Yes, I know, said Gregor to himself;
but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.
 Gregor, said his father now from the room to his left, the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you did not leave on the early train.
We do not know what to say to him.
And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally.
So please open up this door.
I am sure he will be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.
Then the chief clerk called Good morning, Mr.Samsa.
He is not well, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door.
He is not well, please believe me.
Why else would Gregor have missed a train!
The lad only ever thinks about the business.

In the room on his right there followed a painful silence;
in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
 So why did his sister not go and join the others!
She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.
And why was she crying!
Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before!
There was no need to worry about things like that yet.
Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.
For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.
It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.
And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying.

I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I do not see why your parents should not also learn of it.
Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late;
I grant you that it is not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;
but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.
 But Sir, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, I will open up immediately, just a moment.
I am slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I have not been able to get up.
I am still in bed now.
I am quite fresh again now, though.
I am just getting out of bed.
Just a moment.
Be patient!
It is not quite as easy as I had thought.
I am quite alright now, though.

He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room.
He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud Oh!, which sounded like the soughing of the wind.
Now he also saw him he was the nearest to the door his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.
Gregor is mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk is being there, looked at his father.
Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast.
His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.
Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.
So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.
In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.
Meanwhile the day had become much lighter;
part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street which was a hospital could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its fa√ßade;
the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time.

But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left.
He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him.
He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.
It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic.
In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.
 Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.
That was something his parents did not understand very well;
over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future.
Gregor, though, did think about the future.

It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.
He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he had not been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.
But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.
The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark.
He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae of which he was now beginning to learn the value in order to see what had been happening there.
The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs.
One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been and dragged along lifelessly.
 It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it;
it was the smell of something to eat.

Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion:
for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.
 Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.
She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch he had to be somewhere, for God is sake, he could not have flown away she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside.
But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.
Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her.
Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable!
If she did not do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister is feet and beg her for something good to eat.
However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise.
She immediately picked it up using a rag, not her bare hands and carried it out.
Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring.
In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper.

He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father is business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.
Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor is only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible.
So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways.
Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family.
They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them.
They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.
Gregor only remained close to his sister now.
Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way.
During Gregor is short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.
Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.
That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening.
There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent.
What is that he is doing now, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.
 
 Now!, said Mr.Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him.
What do you mean?, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly.
The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour.
I mean just what I said, answered Mr.Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man.
At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions.
Alright, we will go then, he said, and looked up at Mr.Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr.Samsa for his decision.
Mr.Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times.
At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway;
his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.

He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest.
No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him.
As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.
He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it.
He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.
He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.
He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up.
With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.
 He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked.
The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him.
It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush.
She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents At last!.
What now, then?, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness.
 
Mr.Samsa!, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor is father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.
The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.
His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.
He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body.
Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father is behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.
They asked Gregor is father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly.
Meanwhile Gregor is sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted.
She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay the instrument on her mother is lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.
Under his sister is experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.
Gregor is father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.

All these things found their way into Gregor is room.
The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too.
The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she could not use for the time being she would just chuck in there.
He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it.
The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else.
At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to death, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.
 The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.
But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner.
One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.
They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.
Gregor is mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.
The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell.

With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor is father refused to take his uniform off even at home;
while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor is father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here.
The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor is mother and sister to look after it.
Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.
As soon as it struck ten, Gregor is mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he could not sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.
But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed.
Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.
Gregor is mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor is sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect on him.
He would just sink deeper into his chair.

During the five years that he had not been working the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy.
Would Gregor is elderly mother now have to go and earn money!
She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.
Would his sister have to go and earn money!
She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin.
Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.
 He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.
Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it.
He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near;
he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably.
His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.
 If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it;
but as it was it caused him pain.
