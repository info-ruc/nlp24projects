Kerfoot has been the majority owner of the Whitecaps since 2002, when he saved the club from contraction after previous owner David Stadnyk left the club, selling it to United Soccer Leagues. Mallett, a former chief operating officer (COO) of Yahoo!, who was raised in Victoria, British Columbia, and played for several collegiate soccer teams. He later purchased minority stakes in the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball and English soccer club Derby County F.C. Having first met at a charity soccer event in 2005, Mallett partnered with Steve Nash—a two-time National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player who was also raised in Victoria—to put together a bid for a minority share of English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in 2008. After that transaction fell through, the duo contacted Kerfoot about a minority stake in the club. Nash is the older brother of former Whitecaps midfielder Martin Nash. The fourth partner, Steve Luczo, is the president, chairman, and CEO of Seagate Technology and a partner in Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., a group who own the NBA Boston Celtics. Luczo met Kerfoot while the two were both employed by Seagate Technology, and Kerfoot contacted Luczo proposing he become part of the club's MLS bid. In 2009, the group paid a $35 million expansion fee to MLS for the right to join the league.",

        "context": "The new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. At this stage, the new operating system was a singletasking operating system, not a multitasking one such as Multics. The name Unics (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, pronounced as \"eunuchs\"), a pun on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services), was initially suggested for the project in 1970. Brian Kernighan claims the coining for himself, and adds that \"no one can remember\" who came up with the final spelling Unix. Dennis Ritchie and Doug McIlroy also credit Kernighan.\n\nWhen the Computing Sciences Research Center wanted to use Unix on a machine larger than the PDP-7, while another department needed a word processor, Thompson and Ritchie added text processing capabilities to Unix and received funding for a PDP-11. For the first time in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11. A text-formatting program called roff and a text editor were added. All three were written in PDP-11 assembly language. Bell Labs used this initial text-processing system, consisting of Unix, roff, and the editor, for text processing of patent applications. Roff soon evolved into troff, the first electronic publishing program with full typesetting capability.\n\nAs the system grew in complexity and the research team wanted more users, the need for a manual grew apparent. The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on 3 November 1971; commands were documented in the \"man page\" format that is still used, offering terse reference information about usage as well as bugs in the software, and listing the authors of programs to channel questions to them.\n\nAfter other Bell Labs departments purchased DEC PDP-11s, they also chose to run Unix instead of DEC's own operating system. By Version 4 it was widely used within the laboratory and a Unix Support Group was formed, helping the operating system survive by formalizing its distribution.\n\nIn 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C, contrary to the general notion at the time that an operating system's complexity and sophistication required it to be written in assembly language. The C language appeared as part of Version 2. Thompson and Ritchie were so influential on early Unix that McIlroy estimated that they wrote and debugged about 100,000 lines of code that year, stating that \"[their names] may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed\". Although assembly did not disappear from the man pages until Version 8, the migration to C suggested portability of the software, requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms. Version 4 Unix, however, still had considerable PDP-11-dependent code and was not suitable for porting. The first port to other platform was made five years later (1978) for Interdata 8/32.\n\nThe Unix operating system was first presented formally to the outside world at the 1973 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, where Ritchie and Thompson delivered a paper. This led to requests for the system, but under a 1956 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, the Bell System (the parent organization of Bell Labs) was forbidden from entering any business other than \"common carrier communications services\", and was required to license any patents it had upon request. Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product. Bell Labs instead shipped the system for the cost of media and shipping. Ken Thompson quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disks, each accompanied by – according to legend – a note signed, \"Love, Ken\".",

It was discovered by accident in the Neolithic era, when herders accidentally left milk in containers made of animal stomachs. The rennet in the milk turned the milk into curds. The cheese was eventually invented in the Middle East. The word cheese is derived from the Latin word caseus, which means cheese.\nCheese is a dairy product.\nCheese is a dairy product. Cheese is made by coagulating milk in the production of cheese. The coagulation process is facilitated with the enzyme rennet. The milk is then separated into curds and whey. The fatty layer of the milk is formed by the rennet. The milk is then heated to a temperature of about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. The milk is then drained to remove the excess moisture.\nCheese is a byproduct of cow’s milk.\nCheese is a byproduct of cow’s milk. The milk is then heated to a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit.

With 7.5 million residents of various nationalities in a 1,104-square-kilometre (426 sq mi) territory, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated places in the world. Hong Kong is also a major global financial centre and one of the most developed cities in the world.\n\nHong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nOriginally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages, the territory has become one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports.

Hong Kong is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Asia, and the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world. Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, severe income inequality exists among the population. Most notably, housing in Hong Kong has been well-documented to experience a chronic persistent shortage; the extremely compact house sizes and the extremely high housing density are the effects of Hong Kong's housing market being the most expensive housing in the world.\n\nHong Kong is a highly developed territory and has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.952, ranking fourth in the world. The city has the largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world, and its residents have some of the highest life expectancies in the world.

        "res": "How Covid-19 Became The Most Widely Spread Virus In History\nThe coronavirus pandemic that is currently spreading around the world began in China. It's been traced back to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China, which also sold wild animals that people eat.\nChina's top health official said the virus was spreading between people because it was able to linger on surfaces. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made the same statement last month. The virus can linger on surfaces for a few hours to a few days, depending on the environment.\nThe coronavirus is new to people but not to animals. It was first detected in late December in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province.\nThe virus has since spread to more than 100 countries.\nSome of the first patients with the virus reported that they had visited the Wuhan market, which sold live animals and seafood. In 2003, the SARS virus — also a coronavirus — was linked to an exotic animal market in China.\nHere's what we know about the spread of the coronavirus right now:\nThe virus is known as SARS-CoV-2. It's part of the coronavirus family, which includes viruses that cause the common cold. Coronaviruses are named for the spikes on their surface that look like a crown under a microscope.\nThe new virus causes a respiratory infection known as COVID-19. The disease can range from mild to severe. Most patients experience mild symptoms, which include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. But about 20 percent of patients experience more serious symptoms, including pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs.\nThe virus is thought to spread mainly from people who are in close contact with one another, such as caring for an infected person. It can also spread from people who aren't showing symptoms.\nThere is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19. But there are several drugs that are being tested as possible treatments.\nIn the U.S., the FDA has approved two antiviral drugs, remdesivir and chloroquine, for use on people who are hospitalized with COVID-19. Both have been approved for other uses.\nThere are several promising vaccines in the works. A clinical trial for one vaccine in the U.S. started Monday. But there is no guarantee that any of the vaccines will be safe or effective.\nAs of Tuesday, more than 100,000 people have been confirmed to have COVID-19, and more than 3,400 have died. The vast majority of people who have been infected have had mild symptoms that cleared up.\nWhile the number of new cases is increasing, it's still small compared with the number of people who have been infected. Scientists estimate that as many as 490,000 people in China have been infected with the virus.\nThe World Health Organization says the outbreak is a pandemic. A pandemic is a global outbreak of a disease that doesn't have a vaccine or treatment.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the last time a global pandemic happened was in 2009, when H1N1, or swine flu, spread around the world.\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease that can cause cough, fever and difficulty breathing. The disease can spread through close contact with an infected person, but it can also spread through droplets and aerosols, which are tiny particles that can linger in the air for a long time.\nCOVID-19 is spreading very rapidly around the world because it's a new virus that is spreading between people, says Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University. The fact that it spreads easily and quickly is what makes it a pandemic.\nThe virus is new to people, so there isn't a vaccine or treatment that's proven to be safe and effective.\nThat's part of the reason why scientists are so concerned about the virus. They worry that it will spread quickly around the world.\nThe virus is spreading so quickly that people's immune systems haven't had time to develop an immune response. That means that the virus can spread easily between people.\nThe virus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. It's been traced back to a seafood and live animal market in the city, which also sold wild animals that people eat.\nThese markets are common in China. But they are banned in many countries, including the United States, because they can spread diseases.\nThe World Health Organization says that the virus is spreading quickly because it's a new virus that is spreading between people.\nThe virus is spreading very rapidly around the world because it's a new virus that is spreading between people, says Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.\nThe fact that it spreads easily and quickly is what makes it a pandemic.\nThe virus is spreading so quickly that people's immune systems haven't had time to develop an immune response.\nThat means that the virus can spread easily between people.\nThe virus was first detected in December in Wuhan, China.

        "response": "We all know what America stands for. There is no reason to discuss love for guns, indivdual freedom, right to bear firearms, self defence, gun lobby funded by NRA, and how republicans love guns etc etc. These are all facts but it doesn't change that people die everyday and lives are wasted or impacted as a result of poor gun laws.\n\nWhat can be done about this?\n1. People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.\n\n2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. \n\n3. Never sell assault rifles to general public. A person who needs to have assault rifles are insecure by nature. They fear that the public is trying to get at them and they need to protect. Form community monitoring and have more police funding to protect our families.",

They sought to return to what they saw as true Christian simplicity.\nIn 1517, Martin Luther, a professor of theology, posted a list of 95 theological theses criticizing Catholic doctrines. The theses included arguments for the Church's selling of indulgences, the simony of the clergy, the use of images, and the use of papal authority to justify corruption within the Church.\nIn 1534, the Council of Trent convened to address the issues raised. The council was attended by representatives of all levels of the Catholic hierarchy—bishops, priests, monks, and lay theologians.\nThe Council of Trent was a 16th-century Ecumenical Council of the Roman Catholic Church held between December 13, 1545, and January 4, 1563, in Trent, Italy. The Council resulted in decrees on the sacraments, the Church, the scriptures, and the role of bishops, with emphasis on liturgical reforms.\nThe council was one of the most important of the 21 Ecumenical Councils recognized by the Catholic Church, the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople II being the other two important councils.\nThe Council of Trent is the second of three ecumenical councils of the Catholic Church in the history of the Christian Church, the other two being the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople.\nIn 1545, the Council of Trent met for the first time, and, after two centuries of intermittent meetings, it settled on 25 canons, or decrees. The Council established a Latin Vulgate Bible with the Apocrypha, and declared the Bible to be free from error, and therefore that the truth was to be found in the Bible.\nThe Council of Trent was one of the most important councils in the history of the Catholic Church. It was called by Pope Paul III to address the issues of the Protestant Reformation. The council met in four sessions: from December 13, 1545 to January 22, 1547; April 13 to December 4, 1547; September 13, 1548 to October 4, 1551; and December 13, 1551 to January 22, 1552.\nThe Counter Reformation was a 16th-century movement within the Catholic Church aimed at reforming and strengthening it in response to the Protestant Reformation.

While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite. There is a delicious amount of complexity in every bite: a crunch, warm, maybe a little spice, a little sweet from the tomato sauce and of course added complexities from whichever toppings you choose.

        "context": "",
        "response": "Lacrosse is a team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America,[ with its origins with the indigenous people of North America as early as the 12th century.The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.\n\nPlayers use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Both men's and women's field lacrosse have 6v6 versions played on smaller fields, gaining acceptance in multi-sport events. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.\n\nThe modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years. Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908.It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.",

Lacrosse is a team sport that is played with sticks, a ball, and a net.\nPlaying Lacrosse [INST]\nLacrosse is a fast-paced game that is played on a flat field. It is similar to soccer in that players are allowed to move the ball around with their sticks. However, lacrosse is also a very physical sport, with players often colliding with each other.\nThere are six players on a lacrosse team, and each team has one goalie. The goal of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the net.\nThe game is played in two halves, with each half lasting about 30 minutes. There is a 15-minute break between halves.\nThe team that is ahead at the end of the game wins.\nLacrosse is a great sport for kids because it is both physically and mentally challenging. It is also a lot of fun!"

        "context": "Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in the rule of law, separation of powers, and democratic voting. Political scientists have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government. Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military. States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as \"hybrid democracies\", \"hybrid regimes\" or \"competitive authoritarian\" states.\n\nThe political scientist Juan Linz, in an influential 1964 work, An Authoritarian Regime: Spain, defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:\n\nLimited political pluralism, is realized with constraints on the legislature, political parties and interest groups.\nPolitical legitimacy is based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat \"easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.\"\nMinimal political mobilization, and suppression of anti-regime activities.\nIll-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting extend the power of the executive.\nMinimally defined, an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries that lack civil liberties such as freedom of religion, or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections. Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties, legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent, non-competitive elections. In contexts of democratic backsliding, scholars tend to identify authoritarian political leaders based on certain tactics, such as: politicizing independent institutions, spreading disinformation, aggrandizing executive power, quashing dissent, targeting vulnerable communities, stoking violence, and corrupting elections. Since 1946, the share of authoritarian states in the international political system increased until the mid-1970s but declined from then until the year 2000.",

Second step is to carefully measure the open space after you've cut the square.  Take your time and measure as close to the existing drywall as possible.  Take 4 measurements of 2 in length and 2 in width to ensure accuracy.  Cut that square from your replacement drywall.  Shave sides with sandpaper for tight fit.  Once your replacement square fits, insert drywall screws into the sides of the drywall that will also go through the previously exposed wooden studs.  Once the new square is secure, you can layer ontop the drywall paste to let dry.

        "res": "The answer is simple, but the why is a bit more complicated. The answer is that they have different densities. Water has a density of 1.000 g/cm3 and oil has a density of 0.785 g/cm3.\nOil is lighter than water so it floats on top of it. Here’s why: Oil has a lower density than water. That means it’s lighter than water. The reason oil floats on water is because the molecules in oil are more spread out than the molecules in water.\n1 Why does oil float on water?\n3 Why is oil less dense than water?\n4 How does oil float in water?\n5 Why doesn’t oil sink in water?\n7 Do all liquids float on water?\nOil floats on water because it is less dense than water. Oil is made up of hydrocarbons, which are made up of smaller molecules that are not as dense as water molecules. This means that the oil molecules are able to displace the water molecules and float on top of the water.\nSee Also: How To Do A 180 On A Bike\nThere are a few reasons why oil floats on water. First, oil is less dense than water. Second, oil has a lower surface tension than water. Third, oil is less viscous than water.\nOil is less dense than water, so it will float on top of it. This is because oil has a lower density than water. Oil is also less viscous than water, so it is less likely to stick to the bottom of a container.\nWhy is oil less dense than water?\nWhy is oil less dense than water? This is a question that has been asked for centuries, and the answer is not simple.\nOil is lighter than water, so it will naturally float on top of it. But there are two main reasons why oil is less dense than water.\nThe first reason is that oil is a more effective insulator than water. This means that it is less likely to absorb heat from the surrounding air, and this helps to keep the oil from becoming too dense.\nThe second reason is that oil is a more viscous liquid than water. This means that it is less likely to mix with the water, and this helps to keep the oil from becoming too dense.\nSo, why is oil less dense than water? The answer is that it is a better insulator and a more viscous liquid than water.\nHow does oil float in water?\nOil and water do not mix. This is because oil is less dense than water. This means that oil will float on top of water.\nSee Also: How To Fix A Flat Tire On A Bike\nWhy doesn’t oil sink in water?\nOil and water do not mix. This is because they have different densities. Oil is less dense than water, so it floats on the surface.\nOil and water may not mix, but many other liquids do. For example, milk and water mix together to make a milkshake. This is because milk is less dense than water, and so it floats on the surface.\nHaving said that, there are some liquids that do not mix with oil. For example, gasoline and diesel do not mix with oil. This is because they are both more dense than oil, and so they sink to the bottom of the container.\nDo all liquids float on water?\nDo all liquids float on water? The answer to this question is no, not all liquids will float on water. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but for the most part, liquids will not float on water.\nThere are a few different reasons why liquids will not float on water. One reason is that liquids have different densities than water. This means that when liquids are placed on top of water, they will sink to the bottom. Another reason is that liquids have different surface tensions than water. This means that when liquids are placed on top of water, they will not adhere to the surface of the water.\nThere are a few liquids that will float on water. These liquids include water itself, ethyl alcohol, and gasoline. These liquids have low surface tension and low density, which means that they will float on water.\nSo, do all liquids float on water? The answer to this question is no. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but for the most part, liquids will not float on water.\nTags: density water answerDoes oil float wateroil less dense waterWhy does oil float water\nNext Does Samsung Have A Bike\nPrevious Do Bike Racks Have To Be Attached To The Car\nDoes Samsung Have A Bike\nWhat Does The S Stand For In Bmw\nWho Makes The Bike For The Honda Movie\nHow To Do A 180 On A Bike"

        "context": "Renal compensation is a mechanism by which the kidneys can regulate the plasma pH. It is slower than respiratory compensation, but has a greater ability to restore normal values. Kidneys maintain the acid-base balance through two mechanisms,- the secretion of H+ ions and the reabsorption of bicarbonate HCO3 from urine which is then released into the blood. The regulation of H+ ions and bicarbonate HCO3 is determined by the concentration of the two released within the urine. These mechanisms of secretion and reabsorption balance the pH of the bloodstream. A restored acid-base balanced bloodstream thus leads to a restored acid-base balance throughout the entire body.",

        "res": "I've been asked about the phenomenon of renal compensation, which I think is most often used in the literature as a way to explain the changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with the changes in plasma creatinine concentration.\nThe concept of renal compensation is that the kidneys will adjust the GFR so that the plasma creatinine concentration is constant. That is, if plasma creatinine increases, the GFR must decrease, and vice versa.\nWhen the plasma creatinine concentration is normal, GFR is normally constant, but when the plasma creatinine concentration is elevated, the GFR will decrease and vice versa.\nThe kidneys are very good at adjusting GFR, and they do it as part of the normal renal compensation process.\nIn the early stages of the disease, renal compensation can be very effective, and the plasma creatinine concentration will remain normal.\nHowever, as the disease progresses, the kidneys will lose their ability to compensate and the plasma creatinine concentration will increase.\nThe concept of renal compensation is not new. It was first described in the 1930s by Dr. Walter B. C. Alving, who used it to explain the changes in plasma creatinine concentration that occur with normal aging.\nIn the 1950s, Dr. Donald C. Calne used renal compensation to explain the changes in plasma creatinine concentration that occur with renal disease.\nThe concept of renal compensation is also used to explain the changes in plasma creatinine concentration that occur with acute renal failure.\nIn the 1970s, a group of researchers led by Dr. Joseph P. Grimley used the concept of renal compensation to explain the changes in plasma creatinine concentration that occur with chronic renal failure.\nIn the 1990s, a group of researchers led by Dr. John A. Kellum used the concept of renal compensation to explain the changes in plasma creatinine concentration that occur with acute kidney injury.\nThe concept of renal compensation is also used to explain the changes in plasma creatinine concentration that occur with chronic kidney disease.\nIn the 2000s, a group of researchers led by Dr. David S.

He has written several other best-selling books on personal finance and investing, and he has been featured in numerous media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Fox Business News.\nKiyosaki was born in Hawaii and raised by his mother, a social worker, and his grandfather, a Japanese immigrant. His father, a salesman, was absent from his life for most of his childhood. Kiyosaki attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he majored in sociology and education. After college, he worked in the construction industry for several years before becoming an entrepreneur and investor.\nIn the 1980s, Kiyosaki founded Cashflow Technologies, a company that developed software to help small businesses manage their cash flow. The company was successful, and Kiyosaki used the profits from it to invest in real estate and other businesses.\nIn the 1990s, Kiyosaki began writing books on personal finance and investing, which became best-sellers and have sold millions of copies worldwide.

        "context": "",
        "response": "In order to fly, aircraft need to produce lift. In airplanes, lift is generated by the air that's flowing over the wings. The faster the airplane flies, the more lift is generated. In helicopters on the other hand, lift is generated by the spinning rotor blades. If the helicopter is in motion, the blades will produce more lift on the side where they are moving in the helicopter's direction of travel (advancing), than on the side where they are moving in the opposite direction (retreating). This is called dissymetry of lift. The faster the helicopter flies, the bigger this dissymetry will get. The helicopter's maximum speed is equal to the speed at which the retreating blade would begin to stall.",

        "res": "I'm not sure if I'm in the right forum for this, but I was wondering if anyone could explain why helicopters can't fly as fast as airplanes?\nI have a couple of theories, but I'm not sure where they came from.\nMy first theory is that helicopters don't have as much power as airplanes, so they can't fly as fast.\nMy second theory is that helicopters have to use their engines to lift the weight of the helicopter, so they can only fly as fast as the engines can lift the weight of the helicopter.\nAnyone have any other theories?\nThe answer is yes: helicopters can fly as fast as airplanes. However, they cannot maintain the same speed as airplanes for very long periods of time. This is because helicopters must be able to maneuver quickly and precisely to avoid obstacles.\nAirplanes can maintain a certain speed for long periods of time because they are not required to maneuver as much.\nThere are a few factors that limit the speed of helicopters:\n- The power of the engine: Helicopters need a lot of power to fly, and they cannot maintain the same speed as airplanes because they need to use more power to move the blades at a slower speed.\n- The weight of the helicopter: Helicopters are large and heavy, and they cannot maintain the same speed as airplanes because they need to use more power to lift the weight of the helicopter.\n- The drag of the helicopter: Helicopters have a lot of drag, and they cannot maintain the same speed as airplanes because they need to use more power to overcome the drag.\nSo, why can't helicopters fly as fast as airplanes?\nThere are a few reasons. First, helicopters have a lot of drag. This means that they need more power to maintain the same speed as an airplane. Second, helicopters have a lot of weight. This means that they need more power to lift the weight of the helicopter.\nFinally, helicopters have a lot of rotor disks. This means that they need more power to spin the rotor disks.\nSo, why can't helicopters fly as fast as airplanes? There are a few reasons, but the main reason is that helicopters have a lot of drag. This means that they need more power to maintain the same speed as an airplane.\nHow fast can helicopters fly?\nHelicopters can fly at speeds of up to 300 mph (480 km/h). This is the fastest speed that most helicopters can achieve.\nHowever, there are a few helicopters that can fly faster. For example, the Eurocopter AS 350 B2 can reach speeds of up to 320 mph (515 km/h).\nThere are also a few helicopters that can fly faster than 300 mph (480 km/h). For example, the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey can reach speeds of up to 320 mph (515 km/h).\nSo, how fast can helicopters fly? Helicopters can fly at speeds of up to 300 mph (480 km/h), but there are a few helicopters that can fly faster.\nHow fast do helicopters fly?\nHelicopters can fly at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour.\nHelicopters have blades that spin around in a circle, which creates lift. This lift allows the helicopter to fly.\nThe rotation of the blades causes the helicopter to move forward. The faster the blades spin, the faster the helicopter moves forward.\nHelicopters can fly at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. This is because they have blades that spin around in a circle, which creates lift. This lift allows the helicopter to fly.\nHow fast can a helicopter fly at altitude?\nA helicopter can fly at speeds of up to 300 mph at altitude.\nA helicopter can fly at speeds of up to 300 mph at altitude. This is because a helicopter has two rotors that spin in opposite directions. This creates a lift that can help the helicopter fly.\nThe faster a helicopter flies, the more lift it needs. This is because the faster a helicopter flies, the more air pressure it experiences.\nA helicopter can fly at speeds of up to 300 mph at altitude.

Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother, knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way. While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.\n\nMusk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School. Although Musk claims he earned the degrees in 1995, UPenn maintains it awarded them in 1997. He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.\n\nIn 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at the energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at the Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University. However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, instead dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.",

        "instruction": "Is it wrong to split the infinitive?",
        "context": "",
        "response": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?",

        "context": "Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.",
        "response": "Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.  The park is able to support many types of wildlife including Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, mountain goats, free-ranging herds of bison and elk, as well as many types of birds and fish, because of the diversity of habitats.  Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.  Some of the park's most unique features are the geysers and hydrothermal features.  In fact, Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's features like these.  This is due to the entire park being centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent.",

Yellowstone is a place of great biodiversity, where plants and animals from all three of the major North American ecozones have been found. The park is a place where plants and animals from the northern forests, the central and southern grasslands, and the western deserts all coexist. [1]\nThe most common habitats in the park are the forests, meadows, and grasslands. The forests that dominate the park are composed of an even-aged, deciduous forest that is very dense, with thick undergrowth. This forest is composed of a mixture of aspen, willow, cottonwood, birch, pine, and fir trees. Aspen trees are a major component of the forest, as they are highly adaptable and grow rapidly, allowing them to dominate the forest. Meadows are also abundant in the park, as well as the grasslands, which are dominated by sagebrush, sedges, grasses, and wildflowers. The grasslands provide important habitat for a great variety of wildlife, including elk, deer, and antelope.\nIn addition to the forests, meadows, and grasslands, Yellowstone is home to several unique habitats. One of the most famous is the thermal areas, which are composed of steaming springs, geysers, mud pots, and hot springs. These areas are very unique and provide an important habitat for many species of plants and animals.

Throughout the 1970s, he continued to publish in small literary journals, such as The World, Dodgems, Telephone, and Roof.\n\nHis first volume of poetry, titled simply Poems, was published by the Sun & Moon Press in 1988 and won an Author's Recognition Award from the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in 1992.[citation needed] His second chapbook, Light Street, did not appear until 1996. It was followed by Theoretical Objects (1999), a collection of manifestos, aphorisms, essays, and seemingly autobiographical prose poems.\n\nPiombino's poetry took a different turn with Hegelian Honeymoon (2004), in which he moved away from the conventions of Language poetry to explore more traditional forms. Inspired by the poetry that accompanied an exhibition of Japanese calligraphy, the poems are a cross between haiku and aphorism. The poems were originally published on the SUNY/Buffalo poetics list-serve before being published in chapbook form by Chax Press.",

Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines can be made by fermentation of other fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry.",

Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed.",

But what do canines really mean when they raise their tails? Do they feel happy? Sad? Afraid? Does their tail position change when they are feeling different things?\nIn a study, researchers found that dogs might use their tails to communicate only one emotion at a time.\nResearchers from Uppsala University asked 14 dogs questions about their emotions, including how they felt when they were alone, with their owners, sleeping, and eating.\nThey also photographed the dogs with a digital camera, and recorded their position.\nThe canines were photographed from the side and from the front. Images were taken when they were lying down, on their backs, and when they were standing up.\nThe researchers found that the dogs' tail positions did not change when they were lying down or standing, but they did change when they were on their backs.\nThe researchers said that the animals' back-raised tail position may be a signal to their owners that they are feeling happy or relaxed.\nWhile their owners were present, the dogs' tails were raised higher than when they were alone, but not when they were sleeping or eating.\nThe researchers say that one dog's tail position may not mean the same thing for another dog, as the animals might be communicating with owners in different ways.\nWhile they were happy to see their owners, they did not express the same tail position when they were relaxing with other dogs, the researchers said.\nThe study was published in the journal Animal Cognition.\n\"The dog's tail is a very important part of its communication system, and it is one of the most important ways to communicate with its owner,\" said researcher Dr. Karolina Westman, a veterinarian and behaviorist at Uppsala University, in Sweden.\n\"The tail position is part of the dog's body language, and it is very important to understand that it does not mean the same thing for different dogs.\"\n\"What we found is that dogs can communicate different emotions to different people, and that they can use their tails to do so,\" said Dr. Westman.\n\"It is important to understand the different ways that dogs communicate with their owners, and that the tail position is part of that communication.\"\nDoes a dog's tail position change when it is happy or afraid?\nThe researchers say that the dog's tail position is an important part of its communication, and that it is important to understand that it does not mean the same thing for different dogs.\nAccording to Dr. Westman, a dog's tail position may be a signal that it is feeling happy or relaxed.\n\"The dogs' tail position when they are happy or relaxed is very high, and it is a signal to the owner that the dog is feeling good,\" she said.\n\"If the dogs are feeling good, they may also be feeling a little scared, and it may also be a signal to the owner that the dog is feeling anxious.\"\nThe researchers say that the dogs' tail position is part of a dog's body language, and that it is very important to understand that it does not mean the same thing for different dogs.\n\"What we found is that dogs can communicate different emotions to different people, and that they can use their tails to do so,\" Dr. Westman said.\n\"It is important to understand the different ways that dogs communicate with their owners, and that the tail position is part of that communication.\"\nDoes a dog's tail position change when it is sleeping or eating?\nThe researchers found that the dogs' tail position did not change when they were lying down or standing, but it did change when they were on their backs.\n\"The tail position is part of the dog's body language, and it is very important to understand that it does not mean the same thing for different dogs,\" said Dr. Westman.\n\"What we found is that dogs can communicate different emotions to different people, and that they can use their tails to do so.\n\"It is important to understand the different ways that dogs communicate with their owners, and that the tail position is part of that communication.\"\nThe researchers say that the dogs' tail position is part of a dog's body language, and that it is very important to understand that it does not mean the same thing for different dogs.

My father and his family, the Milhouses, had been in California since 1893, and my mother's family, the Nixons, had been in California since 1880. I was a very active child and loved playing outside. My favorite thing was to climb trees and explore the woods near our house. My parents were very supportive of my love of the outdoors, and I spent a lot of time hiking and camping with them. I was also very passionate about politics and was always interested in current events. I was born in Yorba Linda, California, on January 9, 1913. My father, Francis Nixon, was a Quaker minister who had been born in England. He and my mother, Hannah Milhous Nixon, came to the United States in 1910. They were both very religious and strongly opposed to the use of alcohol and tobacco. So much so that I was never allowed to smoke or drink.

        "res": "Because of the sweeping motion of the arms and the high-pressure recovery of the legs, sweep rowing is a great total-body workout.\nWe’ve all sat down in a boat and had a go at rowing.\nIt’s a simple concept – you sit down in the boat, face backward, and then pull the oars back and forth.\nBut it’s a bit more complicated than that.\nWhen people talk about rowing, they often refer to it as ‘sweep rowing’.\nSweep rowing refers to the rowing stroke where the oar blades are on the water at the same time.\nAnd it’s a very efficient way of rowing, as it allows for a high-pressure recovery of the legs.\nThere are a few different types of sweep rowing, but the most common is the sweep stroke.\nThis is where the oar blades are on the water at the same time, and the rower’s legs are moving at the same speed as the boat.\nSweep rowing is also known as ‘sweep and pull’ rowing, and it’s the most popular type of rowing in the world.\nWhen rowing, you’re sitting down in the boat and facing backward.\nYou’re pulling on the oar blades to move the boat forward.\nAnd then you use your legs to push the boat away.\nSo what does sweep rowing actually look like?\nWell, it looks like this…\nWe’ll start with the sweeping motion of your arms.\nAs you pull the oar blade back and forward, the oar blades bend and flex, as they’re pulling the boat forward.\nThe oar blades bend and flex, and then the rower uses his or her legs to push the boat away.\nThe rower uses his or hers legs to push the boat away from the oar blade, and then they use their arms to pull the boat back.\nThis is why sweep rowers are often referred to as ‘sweep and power’ rowers.\nIt’s a very efficient movement, and it requires a lot of power from your legs.\nIt’s also called ‘sweep stroke’, as this refers to the type of stroke where the rower pulls the oar blade back and then pushes the boat forward with the oar blades.\nSo, what’s the difference between sweep stroke rowing and conventional rowing?\nWell, the main difference is that the rower’s legs move at the speed of the oar blades, while the rower uses his or her legs to pull the oar blades forward.\nThis makes sweep stroke rowing a lot more efficient, as your legs are moving at the same speed and your arms are moving at the same rate.\nThis makes the sweep stroke more efficient than conventional rowing.\nThe other difference is that sweep rowers can row faster than conventional rowing.\nIn conventional rowing (also known as ‘sweep power’ rowing), you’re pulling on your oar blades to push the rowers boat away from the oars.\nBut in sweep stroke rowing, you pull your oar blades back and push your boat forward.\nThis allows for a higher-pressure recovery of the oars, which allows you to row faster.\nWhat are the benefits of sweep rowering?\nIt’s an effective way to train your legs and arms.\nYour legs will be working harder, and your arms will be moving faster.\nSo, sweep strokes are a great way to train your legs to be more efficient, and you can train with sweep strokes to help improve your overall performance.\nIt also helps you build strength in your legs.\nWhen you row, your legs are working at the speed you’re moving, and this helps build strength.\nThe same is true for your arms, which are also moving at a high speed.\nSo, when you do sweep strokes, you’re strengthening your legs, and you can build strength in your arms as well.\nThe best part about sweeps is that they’re very easy to train.\nThe main thing you need to know is that you need to practice.\nIf you can’t practice with a sweep stroke on your own, you can still practice with a machine, or even with a buddy.\nThe easiest way to get started with sweep strokes, though, is to practice with the same partner, or with a partner who has a similar stroke to you.\nSo we’ve covered the main differences between sweep and conventional rowing.\nAnd if you’re interested in learning more about sweep stroke, check out our guide to sweep strokes.\nPrevious PostPrevious How to find your rowing strength on the water\nNext PostNext What to do if you’re on a rowing machine"

This is illustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time.

        "context": "C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced \"C plus plus\") is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\n\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).\n\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.",

        "res": "Fifteen years after the first release of this study, I am glad to bring to your attention its updated version.\nWe've got lots of new information on exercise and health and even a few more questions. Therefore, I made a number of adjustments to this study. The new version is now a bit longer, but for me, it is a much better study.\nI am grateful to those who have helped me with this study, and especially to my friend and colleague, Dr. John McDougall, for his invaluable advice.\nThe study is based on 12 weeks of training, performed by 20 different subjects.\nIn this study, I am investigating the effects of weightlifting on health.\nThe subjects, all of whom were healthy at the start of the study, were divided into three groups:\n• Group A, which did weight training;\n• Group B, which did not do weight training;\n• Group C, which did a combination of weight training and running.\nWeight training was performed three times a week, for 12 weeks.\nThe training consisted of the following exercises, performed three sets of 8-10 repetitions, using the same weight as in the first set:\nBench press (with a barbell)\nDumbbell press (both the dumbbells and the barbell)\nDumbbell curl (both the dumbbells and the barbell)\nSquats (the barbell)\nDumbbell squats (the dumbbells)\nLunges (the barbell)\nDumbbell lunges (the dumbbells)\nLeg extension (the machine)\nLeg curl (the machine)\nAll of the exercises were performed either standing or sitting.\nThe weight training program was performed in a gym, with a personal trainer, and all weights and machines were provided by the gym. The trainer made sure that the subjects performed the exercises properly.\nIn addition to the weight training, every subject in Group A and Group B jogged three times a week, for 20 minutes. The subjects chose their own pace.\nThe subjects in Group C did both weight training and running three times a week, for 12 weeks.\nAt the start of the study, the subjects were weighed and measured, and their blood was drawn. They were also tested for strength, endurance, and fat and muscle tissue.\nThe subjects' blood was again drawn and they were tested for strength, endurance, and fat and muscle tissue after the study.\nThe results of the study are summarized in the table below.\nThe table shows that the two groups which did not do any weight training had a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat mass.\nThe increase in the amount of fat on the body was mainly at the expense of the muscle mass.\nThe results for the two groups which did weight training are similar, but slightly more favorable.\nIn both groups, the weight training caused an increase in muscle mass, and a decrease in fat mass.\nThe increase in muscle mass, however, was less in the weight training group.\nThe results for the combination group are also similar, but even more favorable.\nIn this group, the weight training caused an increase in muscle mass, which was slightly greater than in the other two groups.\nIn addition, there was a decrease in fat mass, which was also slightly greater than in the other two groups.\nIn the combined group, the weight training caused an increase in lean body mass, which was slightly greater than in the other two groups.\nThe differences in the three groups were not statistically significant, because of the small number of subjects in each group.\nIn conclusion, the three groups had similar changes in body composition.\nAll of the subjects lost muscle mass, but the amount of muscle lost was slightly lower in the weight training group.\nAll of the subjects gained fat mass, but the amount of fat gained was slightly lower in the weight training group.\nThe amount of fat gained was slightly lower in the combined group.\nThe changes in body composition in the two groups which did not do any weight training were not statistically significant.\nThe changes in body composition in the two groups which did weight training were not statistically significant.\nThe changes in body composition in the combined group were not statistically significant.\nThe changes in body composition in the three groups were not statistically significant.\nThe results of the study show that weight lifting is good for you.\nExercise has been shown to be good for your health.\nWeight lifting can help you lose weight, improve your health, and increase your lean body mass.\nThe combined group had the best results.\nThe combined group had the best results, but the differences were not statistically significant.\nThe combined group did not have significantly different results from the other two groups.\nThe combined group did not have significantly worse results than the other two groups.\nWeightlifting is good for you.\nExercise is good for

Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\".\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13× platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n\nOne of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue.

In colloquial usage, a \"metaverse\" is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social and economic connection.\n\nThe term \"metaverse\" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of \"meta\" and \"universe\". Metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to the increasing demands for immersion. Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3, a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet. Web3 and metaverse have been used as buzzwords to exaggerate the development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes. Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.",

So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.  Look around and think about what you can add to your project.  Last and most basic, put a coat of varnish on it to seal it up - and if you choose give it a bit of shine.  All these ideas will give a little bit of extra finish and pop to your project.",

The word comes from Middle English occean, from Old French occean, from Latin oceanus, from Greek Ωκεανός (Ōkeanós), from Ōkean (ΩΚΕΑΝΟΣ), the personification of all the waters of the world, from Ōkean (ΩΚΕΑΝΟΣ), the personification of the waters surrounding the Earth (equivalent to the Roman Oceanus), which derives from the Proto-Indo-European *wed-r-, which is cognate with Sanskrit Ādityas, and *wed-s, cognate with Sanskrit Varuna.\nThe Earth's oceans have been a major setting for exploration, trade, war, and migration by human beings since historical times. During the age of discovery, the oceans were first thoroughly explored by western sailing ships starting in the 15th century. The oceans were later used as a setting for colonialism.

For other uses, see Self-titled (disambiguation). Not to be confused with Namesake.\nAn eponym is a person, a place, or a thing after whom or which someone or something is, or is believed to be, named. The adjectives which are derived from the word eponym include eponymous and eponymic.Usage of the wordThe term eponym functions in multiple related ways, all based on an explicit relationship between two named things. A person, place, or thing named after a particular person share an eponymous relationship. In this way, Elizabeth I of England is the eponym of the Elizabethan era, but the Elizabethan era can also be referred to as the eponym of Elizabeth I of England.When Henry Ford is referred to as \"the eponymous founder of the Ford Motor Company\", his surname \"Ford\" and the name of the motor company have an eponymous relationship. The word \"eponym\" can also refer to the title character of a fictional work (such as Rocky Balboa of the Rocky film series), as well as to self-titled works named after their creators (such as the album The Doors by the band the Doors).Walt Disney created the eponymous Walt Disney Company, with his name similarly extended to theme parks such as Walt Disney World. Medical eponymous terms are often called medical eponyms although that usage is deprecable.",

When the car pulled behind the grandstands, one teenager fired on a crowd of 300 people with a shotgun, causing seven people to receive injuries. Six of the injured were teenagers, ranged in age from 13 to 19. One received critical injuries. All six received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The shootings occurred at 4:15 PM, and the suspects left the scene. This shooting was the week's second shooting that had high school students involved. The shooting was the second one in a month in which Homecoming activities were involved. Police said that one of the suspects had been involved in a fight on an earlier occasion.\n\nOn April 16, 1987, a student at Murray–Wright entered the school parking lot and shot 17-year-old Chester Jackson, a junior running back, in the head, killing him. The attacker went into the gymnasium and shot 18-year-old Damon Matthews, a basketball player, in the face. Tomeka Turner, an 18-year-old, was wounded. Risen said that Turner's injuries occurred \"apparently in the school's corridors as the attacker fled the building.\" The youth with facial injuries received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The incident occurred around noon. The attacker, Michael Schofield, was 14 at the time of the crime. Schofield, 15 years old at sentencing, was sentenced to serve in a juvenile correctional facility until he turned 19. Schofield killed four people in 2003 during an attempted robbery of a convenience store in Westland, Michigan, and then killed himself. The Los Angeles Times News Service said that the 1987 Murray–Wright shooting was the incident that put \"most clearly into focus\" the epidemic of youth violence in Detroit.\n\nAfter the murder and shootings, school officials started a plan to reduce violence in the school. The school was closed for two days as officials held special assemblies concerning school violence. The school officials said that of the students who appeared at the assemblies at Murray–Wright, half appeared with their parents. This occurred despite fears that few parents would appear.",

        "instruction": "How is binary search vs other searching schemes?",
        "context": "Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking \n\nO(n) time for each such operation. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array. There are other data structures that support much more efficient insertion and deletion. Binary search can be used to perform exact matching and set membership (determining whether a target value is in a collection of values). There are data structures that support faster exact matching and set membership. However, unlike many other searching schemes, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching, usually performing such matches in \nO(log n) time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves. In addition, there are some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, that can be performed efficiently on a sorted array.\n\nLinear search:\n\nLinear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short, although the array needs to be sorted beforehand. All sorting algorithms based on comparing elements, such as quicksort and merge sort, require at least \nO(nlog n) comparisons in the worst case. Unlike linear search, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching. There are operations such as finding the smallest and largest element that can be done efficiently on a sorted array but not on an unsorted array.\n\nTrees:\n\nBinary search trees are searched using an algorithm similar to binary search.\nA binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can be faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.\n\nHowever, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This even applies to balanced binary search trees, binary search trees that balance their own nodes, because they rarely produce the tree with the fewest possible levels. Except for balanced binary search trees, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching \nn comparisons. Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.\n\nBinary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can be efficiently structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes this method of tree organization. B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.\n\nHashing:\nFor implementing associative arrays, hash tables, a data structure that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records.Most hash table implementations require only amortized constant time on average.However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. Binary search also supports approximate matches. Some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, can be done efficiently on sorted arrays but not on hash tables.\n\nSet membership algorithms:\nA related problem to search is set membership. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A bit array is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of bits, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only \nO(1) time.The Judy1 type of Judy array handles 64-bit keys efficiently.\n\nFor approximate results, Bloom filters, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a set of keys by encoding the keys using a bit array and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with \nk hash functions, membership queries require only \n O(k) time. However, Bloom filters suffer from false positives.\n\nOther data structures:\nThere exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.",

        "response": "In the mitochondrion, the matrix is the space within the inner membrane. The word \"matrix\" stems from the fact that this space is viscous, compared to the relatively aqueous cytoplasm. The mitochondrial matrix contains the mitochondrial DNA, ribosomes, soluble enzymes, small organic molecules, nucleotide cofactors, and inorganic ions. The enzymes in the matrix facilitate reactions responsible for the production of ATP, such as the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation of pyruvate, and the beta oxidation of fatty acids.\n\nThe composition of the matrix based on its structures and contents produce an environment that allows the anabolic and catabolic pathways to proceed favorably for. The electron transport chain and enzymes in the matrix play a large role in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The citric acid cycle produces NADH and FADH2 through oxidation that will be reduced in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.\n\nThe cytosolic, intermembrane space, compartment has a water content of 3.8 μL/mg protein, while the mitochondrial matrix 0.8 μL/mg protein. It is not known how mitochondria maintain osmotic balance across the inner mitochondrial membrane, although the membrane contains aquaporins that are believed to be conduits for regulated water transport. Mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 7.8, which is higher than the pH of the intermembrane space of the mitochondria, which is around 7.0–7.4. Mitochondrial DNA was discovered by Nash and Margit in 1963. One to many double stranded mainly circular DNA is present in mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial DNA is 1% of total DNA of a cell. It is rich in guanine and cytosine content. Mitochondria of mammals have 55s ribosomes.",

        "context": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.",

He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\nBorn into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. His campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. He was the first Catholic elected president.\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisors in South Vietnam. He authorized numerous operations to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro, including the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.",

As a result, a number of books have been written on the subject. One of these books is Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ, by Roger Stone.\nRoger Stone is a long-time political operative and consultant. He has worked for a number of high-profile politicians, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. In his book, Stone makes the case that Lyndon B. Johnson was behind the assassination of JFK.\nStone’s argument is based on a number of factors, including the evidence that has been uncovered since the assassination, as well as the connections between Johnson and Kennedy’s assassins. He also points to the fact that Johnson benefited from the event both politically and financially.\nOverall, Who Killed Kennedy is an interesting and well-researched book that makes a convincing case that Lyndon B.

Its total height is 165 m (541 feet), making it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.\n\nIt is located 7.7 km from Terni, a provincial capital of the Italian region of Umbria. \n\nIts source is a portion of the waters of the river Velino. After flowing through Piediluco lake near the community of Marmore (italian), it pours into the valley below formed by the river Nera. The flow of the waterfall depends on an off and on scale with a published schedule to support the power company nearby.\n\nMost of the time, the water in the canals above the Cascata delle Marmore falls is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, so the flow in the falls themselves is heavily reduced. Piediluco Lake, above the falls, is used as a reservoir for the power plant. The Galleto power plant, built in 1929, is architecturally interesting. Its capacity is about 530 MW. To control the operation of the power plant, and to satisfy tourists, the falls are turned on according to a set schedule, achieving a spectacular effect at full flow. An alarm is sounded first, then the gates are opened, and in a few minutes the small stream is transformed into a full-sized river rushing into the void below.\n\nNormally, the falls are turned on between 12:00 and 13:00 and again between 16:00 and 17:00 every day, with additional times on holidays. An entrance fee is charged to visit the falls and the surrounding area.\n\nA path along the falls allows the visitor to hike up to the top of the falls.

He has won five Super Bowls in his career and holds numerous other records.\nTom Brady is another great quarterback who has won four Super Bowls in his career.\nBen Roethlisberger is another quarterback who has won two Super Bowls in his career.\nBut who is the best quarterback of all time?\nThat’s a question that has been debated for years. But now, thanks to the NFL’s statistics, we can answer that question definitively.\nAccording to the NFL, Peyton Manning is the best quarterback of all time. He has a career passer rating of 97.5, which is the highest in NFL history.

        "context": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is considered to be one of the greatest basketball players in history and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career assists. He has won four NBA championships (two with the Miami Heat, one each with the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers), and has competed in 10 NBA Finals. He has four MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He has been named an All-Star 19 times, selected to the All-NBA Team 18 times (including 13 First Team selections) and the All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP. James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning two Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 19 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.",
        "response": "\"King\" James is considered one of basketball's all-time greats because of the dominance and longevity displayed over his career. Lebron has personal accolades for days, including: 4 MVPs, 4 Finals MVPs, 19 All-Star seasons, 1st Team All-NBA 13 times, All-Defensives Team 6 times, and he's still going. When you sum up Lebron's career totals, they are equaling mind-blowing, as the NBA's all-time leading scorer, he is also 4th in career assists. Lebron's greatest achievement on the court is commonly viewed as the time he led the Cleveland Cavaliers back to championship glory, coming back from a 3-1 deficit to the Golden State Warriors in 2016.",
