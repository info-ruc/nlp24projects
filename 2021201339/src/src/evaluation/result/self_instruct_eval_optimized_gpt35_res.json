Heartbreak songs may use imagery of darkness, storms, or shattered glass to convey the pain of loss and disappointment.\n\nSongs about resilience and personal growth often use metaphorical language to convey themes of overcoming obstacles, finding inner strength, and embracing change. Metaphors such as rising from the ashes, spreading wings, and breaking free are commonly used to symbolize personal transformation and empowerment.\n\nIn addition to personal emotions and experiences, song lyrics can also address social and political issues, often using metaphor and symbolism to convey messages of activism, protest, and solidarity. Metaphors such as chains, walls, and bridges are frequently used to symbolize oppression, division, and unity.\n\nOverall, the meaning of song lyrics can be complex and multi-layered, and may evoke different emotions and interpretations for each listener.

The B&B has been in the family for generations but has fallen into disrepair in recent years. The woman, who is struggling to make ends meet, is torn between keeping the property and selling it to alleviate her financial burdens. As she begins the daunting task of renovating the B&B, she uncovers long-buried secrets about her family and the history of the property.\n\nStory:\n\nMaggie had always known about the old bed and breakfast that her grandmother owned. She had spent many summers there as a child, running around the expansive gardens and playing in the cozy rooms. But as she grew older, she realized that the B&B had fallen into disrepair. Her grandmother had struggled to keep it afloat, and when she passed away, she left the property to Maggie.\n\nMaggie was shocked when she found out that the B&B was now hers. She had just lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. The thought of taking on such a huge responsibility was overwhelming, but she couldn't bear the thought of selling the property that had been in her family for generations.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Maggie made the decision to keep the B&B and try to revive it. She took a deep breath and stepped into the neglected building, ready to face the challenge ahead. As she began to sort through her grandmother's belongings, she stumbled upon a dusty old journal hidden in the attic. It belonged to her great-grandmother, who had been the original owner of the B&B.\n\nAs she read through the journal, Maggie discovered that the B&B had a rich history full of secrets. Her great-grandmother had harbored a forbidden love affair with a mysterious man, and the B&B had been a witness to their romance. But as she delved deeper into the journal, Maggie also uncovered a dark family secret that had been buried for years.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Maggie threw herself into the restoration of the B&B. She spent hours cleaning and repairing the neglected rooms, and slowly but surely, the property began to come back to life. As she worked, she couldn't shake the feeling that her great-grandmother's spirit was guiding her, urging her to unravel the mysteries of the past.\n\nFinally, after months of hard work, the B&B was ready to open its doors once again. Guests flooded in, eager to experience the charm of the historic property. But the real reward for Maggie came when she found a hidden compartment in the attic, which contained evidence that revealed the truth behind her family's secrets.\n\nWith the mysteries of the past finally put to rest, Maggie felt a sense of peace and fulfillment. She had not only saved the B&B from ruin but had also unearthed the untold stories of her ancestors. As she sat on the front porch, watching the sunset over the gardens, she knew that she had made the right choice in keeping the property. The old B&B was not just a place to stay; it was a part of her family's legacy, and she was determined to keep it alive for generations to come.",

Make sure to communicate with your team members about the changes you are making, so that everyone is aware of the potential conflicts and can coordinate their efforts accordingly.\n\nResolving Merge Conflicts on GitHub:\n1. When a merge conflict occurs, GitHub will highlight the conflicting files and provide options to resolve the conflicts directly on the platform.\n2. To resolve the conflicts, navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the \"Pull requests\" tab.\n3. Select the pull request that has a merge conflict and click on the \"Resolve conflicts\" button. This will take you to a file comparison view where you can see the conflicting changes.\n4.

Here are the steps to resolve merge conflicts locally:\n\n1. Pull the latest changes from the main repository to your local repository using the command `git pull origin main`.\n2. Git will notify you if there are any conflicts and will mark the conflicting files in your working directory.\n3. Open the conflicting files in a text editor and manually resolve the conflicts by editing the conflicting lines. Remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` and make sure the final file reflects the changes you want to keep.\n4. After resolving the conflicts, add the modified files to the staging area using the command `git add <file>` for each resolved file.\n5. Once all conflicts are resolved and the files are staged, commit the changes using the command `git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflicts\"`.\n6. Finally, push the changes to the remote repository using the command `git push origin <branch-name>`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively resolve merge conflicts both on GitHub and locally, ensuring that your codebase remains clean and consistent.",

        "res": "The cinematography in the movie is a standout feature, with the use of lighting, camera work, and overall aesthetic creating a visually stunning and immersive experience for the audience.\n\nThe use of lighting in the film is particularly notable, with the cinematographer employing a variety of techniques to create mood and atmosphere. For example, in the opening scene, the use of harsh, high-contrast lighting creates a sense of tension and unease, foreshadowing the drama that is to unfold. In contrast, in the romantic scenes, soft, diffused lighting is used to create a warm and intimate atmosphere, drawing the audience into the characters' emotions and relationships. The contrast between these different lighting techniques helps to emphasize the shifts in tone and emotion throughout the film, enhancing the overall storytelling experience.\n\nFurthermore, the camera work in the movie is dynamic and visually captivating, with the cinematographer using a combination of long takes, fluid camera movements, and creative framing to bring the story to life. For example, in a pivotal action sequence, the use of handheld camera work and quick, dynamic movements creates a sense of urgency and chaos, immersing the audience in the high-stakes drama. In contrast, in more contemplative moments, the use of slow, deliberate camera movements and carefully composed framing allows the audience to reflect on the characters' emotions and internal struggles. These cinematographic choices not only serve to enhance the storytelling but also add depth and dimension to the characters and their experiences.\n\nOverall, the aesthetic of the film is characterized by its attention to detail and artistry, with the cinematographer paying careful attention to composition, color palette, and visual symbolism. For example, in a recurring motif throughout the film, the use of reflective surfaces and mirrors adds a layer of visual metaphor, representing the characters' internal conflicts and self-examination. Additionally, the use of bold, vibrant colors in certain scenes heightens the emotional impact of the narrative, while more muted, desaturated tones in other scenes create a sense of melancholy and introspection.\n\nIn conclusion, the cinematography in the movie is an integral part of its storytelling, with the use of lighting, camera work, and overall aesthetic creating a visually rich and emotionally resonant experience for the audience. The cinematographer's careful attention to detail and artistry not only enhances the narrative but also adds depth and complexity to the characters and their world.",

These factors can be broadly categorized into two main areas: internal and external.\n\nInternal factors include the company's unique resources, capabilities, and competencies. These can include tangible assets such as physical infrastructure, technology, and financial resources, as well as intangible assets such as brand reputation, intellectual property, and human capital. A company's ability to effectively leverage these resources and capabilities to produce high-quality products or services, innovate, and respond to market changes is a crucial determinant of its competitive advantage.\n\nExternal factors encompass the market environment in which the company operates, including the industry structure, customer needs and preferences, and competitive dynamics. Understanding and effectively navigating these external factors is key to developing a sustainable competitive advantage. For example, a company may have an advantage in a fragmented market where it can dominate a niche segment, or it may differentiate itself in a highly competitive market through unique product features or superior customer service.\n\nIn addition to these internal and external factors, a company's strategic decisions and management practices play a critical role in shaping its competitive advantage. This includes aspects such as product positioning, pricing strategies, supply chain management, and marketing activities, all of which contribute to a company's ability to create and sustain a competitive edge.\n\nUltimately, a company's competitive advantage is the result of its ability to effectively combine and leverage these various factors to create superior value for customers, outperform competitors, and achieve sustainable profitability. It requires a deep understanding of the company's internal strengths and weaknesses, the external market dynamics, and a clear strategic direction to capitalize on these factors. Companies that are able to continuously adapt and evolve in response to changes in the market and technology are more likely to maintain their competitive advantage over time.",

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter.

Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream.

        "res": "Mindfulness is a mental exercise that involves intentionally focusing on the present moment without judgment. It is a technique rooted in ancient meditation practices and has been found to be highly effective in helping individuals manage their anxiety. By practicing mindfulness, individuals can learn to better cope with their anxious thoughts and feelings, leading to a reduction in overall stress and anxiety levels.\n\nOne way to practice mindfulness is through meditation. To begin, find a quiet and comfortable space to sit or lie down. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath entering and leaving your body. As you continue to breathe, pay attention to any thoughts, emotions, or bodily sensations that arise without trying to change or analyze them. Simply observe them with curiosity and then return your focus to your breath. The goal is to cultivate a nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment and to bring your attention back to the here and now whenever it wanders.\n\nIn addition to meditation, mindfulness can also be practiced throughout the day by engaging in everyday activities with full attention. This might involve eating mindfully, noticing the taste, texture, and smell of your food, or walking mindfully, paying attention to the sensation of each step and the sights and sounds around you. By incorporating mindfulness into daily routines, individuals can train their minds to become more present and less reactive to anxious thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe benefits of practicing mindfulness for anxiety management are numerous. Firstly, mindfulness allows individuals to develop a greater awareness of their thought patterns and emotional responses, leading to a greater sense of control over their anxiety. By learning to observe their anxious thoughts without becoming entangled in them, individuals can reduce the intensity and frequency of their anxious feelings. Additionally, mindfulness can help individuals develop a more compassionate and accepting attitude towards themselves, which can be particularly beneficial for those struggling with anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, research has shown that regular mindfulness practice can lead to physical changes in the brain, including a reduction in the size of the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for the fear response. This can result in a decreased reactivity to stress and anxiety triggers. Overall, the regular practice of mindfulness can lead to a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms and an improved overall sense of well-being.",

I find that having specific targets to work towards helps to keep me focused and motivated. I break these goals down into smaller, manageable steps, which makes them feel more attainable and allows me to track my progress.\n\nI also make it a point to practice positive affirmations regularly. I find that repeating positive statements about myself and my abilities helps to boost my confidence and keep me in a positive mindset. For example, I might tell myself \"I am capable and confident\" or \"I have the skills and resources to succeed.\" These affirmations help to counter negative self-talk and build a strong sense of self-belief.\n\nVisualization is another mental exercise that I find incredibly powerful. I take the time to vividly imagine myself achieving my goals and experiencing the success I desire. I visualize the specific actions I need to take, as well as the feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment that come with reaching my goals. This practice helps to solidify my motivation and drive, and it also helps to reduce any feelings of doubt or fear.\n\nIn addition to these specific mental exercises, I also prioritize self-care and mindfulness to keep myself inspired. I make sure to take breaks when needed, engage in activities that bring me joy, and practice mindfulness techniques such as meditation and deep breathing. These practices help to calm my mind, reduce stress, and keep me in a positive and inspired state of mind.\n\nOverall, these mental exercises help me to stay focused, motivated, and inspired in pursuing my goals and aspirations. By setting clear goals, practicing positive affirmations, visualizing success, and prioritizing self-care, I am able to maintain a strong sense of motivation and self-belief.",

This could be work-related, relationship issues, financial stress, or health concerns. Once you have identified the sources of stress, you can work on addressing them directly.\n\n2. Regular exercise: Physical activity has been proven to be an effective stress reliever. Exercise helps to increase the production of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. It also helps to reduce levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. Whether it's going for a run, practicing yoga, or hitting the gym, regular exercise can greatly reduce stress levels.\n\n3. Practice relaxation techniques: Incorporating relaxation techniques into your daily routine can help to manage stress. This could include deep breathing exercises, meditation, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation. These techniques can help to calm the mind and body, reducing the physical and emotional effects of stress.\n\n4. Time management: Poor time management can often lead to increased stress levels. Learning to prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, and manage your time effectively can help to reduce feelings of overwhelm and stress.\n\n5. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eating a balanced diet, getting an adequate amount of sleep, and limiting alcohol and caffeine intake can all contribute to reducing stress. A healthy lifestyle can help to support your body in managing stress more effectively.\n\n6. Seek support: Talking to someone about your stress can help to alleviate some of the burden. This could be a friend, family member, therapist, or support group. Sharing your feelings and concerns can provide perspective and support, helping to reduce stress levels.\n\n7. Set boundaries: Learning to say no and setting healthy boundaries is important for managing stress. Taking on too much can lead to feelings of overwhelm and increased stress. Learning to prioritize your commitments and set boundaries can help to reduce stress levels.\n\n8. Take breaks: It's important to take regular breaks throughout the day to rest and recharge. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, practicing deep breathing, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy. Taking breaks can help to reduce stress and improve overall productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, managing stress effectively involves a combination of identifying the sources of stress, implementing healthy lifestyle habits, and using relaxation techniques. By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can better manage and reduce stress levels.",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

        "context": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
