I have been a patient here for seven years and I am very pleased with the care I have received. I believe that there is no place better than your hospital.\nI have been a patient at your hospital for about four years. In this time I have had two surgeries, a number of tests, and a number of visits with various specialists. After the second surgery I was released with a prescription for pain medication. I did not fill the prescription because I thought I would be home in time to get my kids from school. I was at work when the accident happened and I missed the bus. I waited awhile for the next bus, but I missed the next one as well. I called a taxi and had to wait a long time for it to arrive. By the time I arrived at my home I was in terrible pain and I took the pain medication.\nI am writing to you because I did not feel that your staff was very helpful in the event that I missed my ride. I believe that I should have been provided with an alternative. I am very upset about the way I was treated by your staff. I do not wish to make a complaint.

        "res": "This article is an excerpt from the EasyAzon Pro Training Manual.\nWhat is a product description?\nA product description is the written text that you will see on your ClickBank affiliate product’s page.\nIt’s important to have a short (~150 words) but informative product description because it’s the first thing that the potential buyers will read about the product.\nHow to write a good product description?\nAlthough it’s not an exact science to write a product description, there are few things that are common to all product descriptions:\n1. Keep the written text short and informative.\n2. Write the product description in a way that will inform the potential buyers what the product is about.\n3. Include a call to action (CTA).\nWhat is a call to action?\nA call to action is a phrase that the seller adds in the product description. This phrase tells the potential buyer what to do next.\nHere are a few examples of calls to action:\n“Click here to order the product.”\n“Click here to read more about the product.”\n“Click here to find out how the product can help you.”\n“Click here to buy the product.”\nWhen you’re writing your calls to action, you need to make sure that they are short and easily readable.\nMake sure that they do not take up the entire screen and make sure that they are not hard to read. You don’t want the potential buyer to get distracted from reading the product description.\nWhy is it important to include a call to action in the product description?\nThe call to action is what will determine the potential buyer to click on the product. Without it, you will not have any sales.\nIncluding a call to action is one of those things that you need to do. You can’t skip this step if you want to have a successful ClickBank affiliate business.\nThis is because the potential buyers will have a hard time knowing what to do next. They can’t just see the product description and immediately buy the product. The product description needs to be written in a way that will encourage them to click on the product.\nWhat’s the difference between the title and the product description?\nThe title and the product description are two different things. The title is the name of the product and the product description is the written text that you will see on the product page.\nThe title will tell you the name of the product while the product description will tell you what the product is about.\nHere is an example of a product page:\nThis is an example of a product page for the EasyAzon Pro training manual. As you can see, the title is “EasyAzon Pro Training Manual” and the product description is “This training manual will teach you how to set up your ClickBank affiliate business and start making money.”\nThe title tells you the name of the product while the product description tells you what the product is about.\nThe title is important because it will make the potential buyers know what the product is about. Without a title, they will not know what the product is for and you will not have any sales.\nOn the other hand, the product description is important because it will make the potential buyers know what the product can do for them. Without a product description, the potential buyers will not know what the product can do for them and you will not have any sales.\nWhen you’re writing your product description, make sure that you include calls to action. These calls to action will encourage the potential buyers to click on the product.\nThis is because the product description needs to be written in a way that will encourage them to click on the product.\nIf you don’t include calls to action, you will not have any sales.\nMake sure that you keep the written text short and informative.\nMake sure that you write the product description in a way that will inform the potential buyers what the product is about.\nMake sure that you include a call to action in the product description.\nWhen you’re writing the product description, make sure that you include calls to action.

I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",
        "output": "I would be as honest as you can while being nice. Next time you’re both in the hotel or wtv just say “hey man, I was thinking about when we get to X—it seems like we like to travel really differently and I think it’s stressing us both out, so how do you feel about splitting up after that stop?”",
        "res": "The question is: \"What should you do when someone is not taking your advice?\"\nMy answer is: \"It depends.\"\nThere are many situations in life, where you are right and the other person is wrong. In these cases, you know what to do and it's easy to make a decision. But, in other cases, the situation is not so clear. In these cases, you should take the time to really understand the situation and find the best solution.\nSometimes, a person is not taking your advice because he or she is not ready to hear it. This could be because they are not ready to change or because they do not understand the situation. In these cases, you should take the time to explain your point of view and give the best advice you can.\nAnother possibility is that the person is not taking your advice because they think it is not the best solution for them. In these cases, you should try to understand their point of view and find a solution that works for both of you.\nIn the end, it is important to remember that everyone is different. What works for one person may not work for another. So, you should take the time to understand the situation and find the best solution for everyone involved.\nWhat is the best way to deal with someone who is not taking your advice?\nThis is a question that has been asked for centuries and the answer is always the same - it depends. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, as it depends on the situation, the people involved and the specific advice that is being given. However, there are a few tips that can help you deal with this situation in the best way possible.\nFirst, try to understand why the person is not taking your advice. Is it because they don't think it's a good idea? Or are they just being stubborn? Once you understand the reason, you can try to find a solution that will work for both of you.\nIf the person is not taking your advice because they think it's a bad idea, try to explain why you think it's a good one. Maybe you can see the potential benefits that they can't, or maybe you can show them how it will work in practice.\nIf the person is being stubborn, try to find a way to compromise. Maybe you can suggest an alternative solution that they might be more willing to accept.\nIn the end, the best way to deal with someone who is not taking your advice is to understand the situation and find a solution that works for both of you. This might take some time and effort, but it will be worth it in the end.\nHow should you respond when someone is not taking your advice?\nIt can be frustrating when someone you are trying to help is not taking your advice. Here are a few tips on how to respond when someone is not taking your advice:\n1. Try to understand why the person is not taking your advice.\nThere may be several reasons why the person is not taking your advice. Maybe they do not trust you, or maybe they do not think your advice is helpful. Try to understand the person's point of view and see if there is a way to address their concerns.\n2. Offer to help in other ways.\nIf the person is not taking your advice, offer to help in other ways. Maybe you can offer to do something else that they need help with. Or maybe you can offer to answer their questions.\n3. Be patient and understanding.\nIt can be frustrating when someone is not taking your advice. However, it is important to be patient and understanding. Remember that the person is not taking your advice because they have their own reasons.\nIf the person is not taking your advice, be patient and understanding. Offer to help in other ways, and be patient and understanding. In time, the person may start to take your advice.\nWhat are some common reasons why people don't take advice?\nThere are a few common reasons why people don't take advice. One reason is that they don't trust the person giving the advice. Another reason is that they may not see the advice as being applicable to their situation. Finally, people may not be open to change and may resist taking advice that would require them to make changes in their lives.\nWhat are some ways to give advice that people will actually take?\nWhen it comes to giving advice, it's important to keep in mind that people are often more likely to take advice from someone they trust. So, if you want to ensure that the advice you give is actually taken, it's important to build a relationship of trust with the person you're giving advice to.\nOne way to do this is by being genuine and authentic in your interactions with the person. When people feel that you're being honest and upfront with them, they're more likely to trust your advice.\nAnother way to build trust is by being open and transparent about your own experiences and struggles. When people see that you're willing to share your own vulnerabilities, they're more likely to trust you and take your advice.\nFinally, it's important to be open to feedback and willing to listen to the person you're giving advice to. When people feel that you're open to their opinions and ideas, they're more likely to trust your advice and be willing to take it.\nSo, if you want to ensure that the advice you give is actually taken, it's important to build a relationship of trust with the person you're giving advice to. By being genuine and authentic, open and transparent, and open to feedback and willing to listen, you can build a strong foundation of trust that will make it more likely that the advice you give will be taken.\nWhat are some common mistakes that people make when giving advice?\nPeople often make mistakes when giving advice. One common mistake is assuming that what works for you will work for everyone. Another mistake is not listening to the person you're advising. If you assume you know what the person needs without listening to them, you'll likely give bad advice. Finally, it's important to be honest with the person you're advising. If you're not being honest, they'll likely not take your advice.\nWhat are some common responses to people who don't take your advice?\nWhen you give advice to someone, it's important to keep in mind that not everyone will take it. In fact, there are a number of common responses that people may have when they don't take your advice. Here are three of the most common:\n1. \"I'm not interested.\" This is the most common response when someone doesn't take your advice. They may say they're not interested in what you have to say, or they may simply ignore you.\n2. \"I don't think it's necessary.\" This is another common response when someone doesn't take your advice. They may say that what you're suggesting isn't necessary, or they may say that they don't think it will work.\n3. \"I don't think it's right.\" This is the most extreme response when someone doesn't take your advice. They may say that what you're suggesting is wrong, or they may say that they don't think it's right for them.\nHow do you deal with someone who is not taking your advice?\nWhen someone is not taking your advice, it can be frustrating. You may feel like you're trying to help, but they just don't seem to be listening. Here are a few tips on how to handle this situation:\n1. Try to understand why they're not taking your advice.

Sometimes, it just takes a little more time for someone to come around to your way of thinking.\n3. Offer to help them in other ways. Maybe you can offer to do something for them, or you can offer to answer their questions.\n4. Be persistent. If they're not taking your advice, keep trying. Eventually, they may come around to your way of thinking.\nWhat are some tips for giving advice that people will actually take?\nWhen you give advice, it's important to keep in mind that not everyone will take it. Sometimes, people just don't want to hear what you have to say. Other times, they may not be in the right frame of mind to receive your advice.\nIf you want people to actually take your advice, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure that you are giving good advice. If you are not sure if your advice is good or not, ask someone else for their opinion. Second, be confident in your advice. If you are not confident in your advice, people will not be confident in taking it. Finally, be patient. It may take time for people to take your advice.\nIf you follow these tips, you will be able to give advice that people will actually take.\nHow do you deal with someone who is not taking your advice?\nWhen you give someone advice, it's important to keep in mind that not everyone will take it.

No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,” said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n“I am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.”\nIn June, England’s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark’s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n“I am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,” he said on Tuesday.\n“As captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.”",

Miller was murdered, and that his spirit has been haunting the cemetery ever since his death.\" The professor is saying, \"I believe that Joseph P. Miller was murdered and that his spirit has been haunting the cemetery ever since his death, but I don't believe that the haunting is due to the combination of natural causes and suicide.\"\n[FACT] The medium and the demonologist are standing several feet away from the grave marker, listening to the conversation.

        "res": "# Merge Conflict Resolution\n\n## Resolving Merge Conflicts\n\nIn the event of a merge conflict, Git will prevent you from merging the branch into the main branch. You will see this in the following format:\n\n![Git Merge Conflict](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320788/150650503-d710cfb7-e240-46c5-82ed-a466aa969f89.png)\n\nThis is a very useful feature of Git, as it prevents you from accidentally committing a merge conflict. Instead, you can resolve the conflict and then commit the merge.\n\n### Resolving Merge Conflicts Locally\n\nFirst, you will need to open the file in question (or the files in question) and resolve the merge conflict.\n\nOnce you have resolved the merge conflict, you can open the `git status` command and view the changes. You will notice that there are unstaged changes, which means you will need to stage the changes before committing.\n\n![Git Merge Conflict Staging](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320788/150650334-4f716df1-075e-4e6e-b233-f57588cba60b.png)\n\nYou will need to stage the changes by adding them to the index. In order to do so, you will need to open the file `git add .` or you can use `git add file_name`.\n\nOnce you have staged the changes, you can open the `git status` command and confirm that you are ready to commit.\n\n![Git Merge Conflict Commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320788/150650359-51562365-7287-4a20-91d4-61b347378bbc.png)\n\nThen, you will need to enter your commit message and the commit will be created.\n\n![Git Merge Conflict Commit Message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320788/150650380-6acfb922-4f5a-497d-8e7f-93428e7d147d.png)\n\nNow, you will need to merge your branch into the main branch. You will do this by opening the `git status` command and creating a new commit on the main branch.\n\n![Git Merge Conflict Commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320788/150650428-cd823809-5114-4474-a798-22e787e9f33e.png)\n\nOnce you have created the commit and merged your branch into the main branch, you can open the `git status` command and confirm that the merge is complete.\n\n![Git Merge Conflict Confirmation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9320788/150650482-6de3d549-d99d-4801-9794-434e23a28b8d.png)"

Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?\nQuestion2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.\nI am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.\nAlso, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.\nI find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).\nSo, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?\nCan you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?",
        "output": "Yes, they are duplicates.",
        "res": "[INST]\nYou are given two questions. Check if they are duplicates.\n\nFor example, given the following pairs of questions:\n\n  {4, 3}\n  {1, 1}\n  {2, 1}\n  {2, 3}\n  {1, 2}\n\nWe can see that {4,3} and {2,1} are duplicates.\n\nYou can assume that the pair of questions are in the same order.\n\nYou can also assume that the pair of questions are in an increasing order.\n\nYou must output the number of duplicates of the pair of questions.\n\n**Input Format**\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers, the total number of questions.\n\nThe next line contains M space-separated integers, where each integer is a question.\n\n**Constraints**\n\n1 <= total questions <= 100\n\n1 <= question <= 100\n\n**Output Format**\n\nPrint a single integer, the number of duplicates of the pair of questions.\n\n**Sample Input**\n\n5\n4 3\n1 1\n2 1\n2 3\n1 2\n\n**Sample Output**\n\n3\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe pair of questions {4,3} and {2,1} are duplicates.\n\nAnother pair of questions {1,1} and {2,1} are also duplicates.\n\nWe can also see that the pair of questions {1,1} and {4,3} are also duplicates.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### 1. Naive approach\n\nFirst print out the `total questions` times `question` and then store the `question` in a `Set` data structure.\n\n```\nQueue<int> q;\nq.enqueue(int(x));\nSet<int> h;\nfor(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++){\n    h.insert(q.dequeue());\n}\ncout << h.size();\n```\n\n#### 2. Sorting\n\nSort the `question` and store it in a `Set` data structure.\n\n```\nQueue<int> q;\nq.enqueue(int(x));\nSet<int> h;\nfor(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++){\n    h.insert(q.dequeue());\n}\nsort(h.begin(), h.end());\ncout << h.size();\n```\n\n#### 3. Hashing\n\nAnother way to do this is to store the `question` in a `HashSet` data structure.\n\n```\nQueue<int> q;\nq.enqueue(int(x));\nHashSet<int> h;\nfor(int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++){\n    h.insert(q.dequeue());\n}\ncout << h.size();\n```\n\n#### 4. DP\n\nWe can solve this problem using dynamic programming.\n\n```\nQueue<int> q;\nq.enqueue(int(x));\nint n = q.size();\nvector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\n    for(int j = i; j < n; j++){\n        if(i + j == n) dp[i] = dp[j];\n        else dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[j];\n    }\n}\ncout << dp[n];\n```\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Programming\n\n```\nQueue<int> q;\nq.enqueue(int(x));\nint n = q.size();\nint dp[n + 1];\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++){\n    for(int j = i; j < n; j++){\n        if(i + j == n) dp[i] = dp[j];\n        else dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[j];\n    }\n}\ncout << dp[n];\n```\n\n## References\n\n- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-duplicate-question-pairs/>\n- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-questions-are-duplicates/>\n- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-dp-1-find-number-duplicate-question-pairs/>\n- <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-questions-are-duplicates-using-dp-dynamic-programming/>"

The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish.

A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

This section should not take you an entire week.\n- Installing and Using Python\nIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.\n- Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)\nIn the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\n- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions\nIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.\n- Chapter Three: Conditional Code\nIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns.

Your arrival transfer is included.\n2- DAY 2: MARRAKECH/OUARZAZATE\nWind past red slopes and green terraces as we make our way south through the stunning valleys of Morocco’s High Atlas Mountains, stopping to enjoy a picnic lunch beside a sparkling river. Arrive in Ouarzazate, known as the “gateway to the Sahara,” and step behind the scenes at a film studio to see how the surrounding dunes have starred on the silver screen.\n3- DAY 3: OUARZAZATE/MERZOUGA\nToday, travel between jagged peaks and palm oases toward the desert town of Merzouga. Settle into our hotel near the incredible Erg Chebbi, a sweeping sea of dunes formed by wind-blown sand. As the sun sets, savour a traditional Amazigh dinner, then spread a blanket on the sand for an evening of desert stargazing.\n4- DAY 4: MERZOUGA\nThis morning, hop aboard a 4x4 and ride across the dunes to discover fossils left behind by an ancient sea, and be entranced by Gnaoua musicians in a local village. Return to the hotel for free time to cool off in the pool. Enjoy a tasty Amazigh dinner, then gather around a glowing bonfire for a storytelling session.\n5- DAY 5: MERZOUGA/DADES GORGE\nVenture into the rugged landscape of the Dades Gorge, a dramatic and colourful valley carved by the waters of the Dades River. Visit a local village for lunch and enjoy a special dish—traditional Amazigh pizza! Wind through the valley on a guided walk as you learn about the amazing geology behind the weird and wonderful rock formations of the Gorge. This evening, enjoy free time to relax at the hotel.\n6- DAY 6: DADES GORGE/AÏT BEN HADDOU\nDrive through the Ounila Valley to the ancient fortified village of Aït Ben Haddou, a UNESCO World Heritage site where clay houses crowd together in a traditional ksar behind defensive walls. Explore alleyways twisting between historic structures, and stand guard atop the clay brick ramparts, taking in views of the green oasis around this imposing fort. Entertain your taste buds at a hands-on tagine cooking class, followed by a delicious dinner.\n7- DAY 7: AÏT BEN HADDOU/MARRAKECH\nJourney through the mountains to Marrakech, known as the “red city” for its walls, houses, and many mosques built from red clay. After checking into your hotel and resting up, head to a local henna workshop to have your hands painted in this ancient temporary tattooing art. Then, explore the lively Djemaa el Fna, an ancient marketplace still used as the main square in Marrakech. After, enjoy free time to discover more of Marrakech.\n8- DAY 8: MARRAKECH \nWake up as the call to prayer echoes across the city. After breakfast, set out on a guided walk through the narrow, maze-like streets of the medina, lined with colorful shops brimming with rugs, spices, and much more. Spend the rest of the day exploring Marrakech on your own, or opt to explore the Marjorelle Garden. In the evening, gather for a farewell dinner in a traditional riad, a grand house with an elegant interior courtyard.\n9- DAY 9: MARRAKECH\nDepart at any time.",

As the battery is used the voltage will decrease until the voltage is not enough to run the application ( E.g. a red LED) and will be called 'dead' . But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage. The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit. The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.\nHere is the required steps:\n1- Connect a switch to a battery holder. A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.\n2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.\n3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.\n4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts)\n5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts)\n6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.\n7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.\n8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up.",

It also needs to rotate on itself. Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can. This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can.",

        "output": "The green light symbolizes several different things to different characters throughout the book, but overall, it stands for the inaccessibility of the American Dream. At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it.",
        "res": "As an author, Charles Dickens was a novelist, playwright, journalist, and editor. He is best known for his novels, which were published in serial form and were published as books. He is also known for his social reforms, which he wrote about in his novels. Dickens was born in Portsmouth, England, in 1812. His father, John Dickens, was an officer in the Royal Navy. Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, was a housekeeper. He was the second youngest of eight children. Dickens's father was imprisoned for debt when Dickens was twelve years old. This event had a profound effect on Dickens, and he later wrote about it in his novels. Dickens was educated at a private school in Chatham, England. After leaving school, Dickens worked as a clerk in a law office. He then became a reporter for a local newspaper. Dickens later moved to London and began writing for newspapers and magazines. In 1833, Dickens published his first novel, \"The Pickwick Papers.\" The novel was a huge success and made Dickens a wealthy man. He went on to write many more novels, including \"Oliver Twist,\" \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" \"The Old Curiosity Shop,\" and \"Bleak House.\" Dickens also wrote plays and essays. He was a prolific writer, and his works have been translated into many languages. Dickens died in 1870.\n[INST] Above is an example of a high school literature question."

I’ll take any of the variations you have here. I’ve used a lot of these ingredients in my cooking, so I’m sure I can use them in mac and cheese, too.\nThanks, Tara! I’m excited to share some other recipes in this series with you as well!\nMegan says: March 29, 2017 at 10:21 am\nI can’t wait for the next 3 recipes. I am always looking for new ways to make macaroni and cheese.\nThanks, Megan! I’m excited to share the next 3 recipes in the series with you!\nAnne says: March 29, 2017 at 10:41 am\nI don’t care for Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. I know, I know. It’s a classic. But I found some other brands that are much better.\nThanks, Anne! I have to admit, I’m not a fan of Kraft Mac and Cheese. I like to make my own instead!\nSarah"

Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world...\nFor starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (\"The\") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will, and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.",

He paused for a moment to look at the house, then, at the sound of footsteps, turned quickly around; but the path was empty.\n\nAs he stood there, the young man looked steadily at the house. It was a plain structure, with white window-shutters, and a front door of unpainted wood. The shutters were raised, and from within came the sound of voices, and the dull murmur of a piano.\n\nThe young man had noted the house before, as he had passed it many times on his way to the town. Its inmates he had never seen, but he had heard of them. In the village, they were called \"The Quinneys,\" and it was said that many years ago, the great-grandfather of the present head of the family had come to the country, and had bought the house, and the land it stood upon.\n\nAs the young man gazed at the house, a girl came out of a door which opened from the hallway. She was a tall, dark-haired girl, with a beautiful, oval face, and bright, dark eyes. She was dressed in a plain, white dress, and she carried a large basket filled with flowers. As she came out of the door, the young man turned to go on his way, but the girl stopped him.\n\n\"Are you looking for someone?\" she asked, with a smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"I am looking for--\"\n\n\"If you are looking for Mr. Quinney, you have come to the right place,\" she said, as she pointed to the house. \"He is in there.\"\n\n\"But I thought he was in New York,\" the young man said.\n\n\"He is,\" she answered, \"but he is visiting us now. May I take your flowers?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" the young man said, as he gave her the flowers.\n\n\"That is a beautiful bunch,\" she said, \"and I am sure it will please Mrs. Quinney. I will go in at once and tell her. I am sure she will be glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I will wait here,\" the young man said, as he leaned against a fence.\n\nA moment later, the girl came out of the door. She had changed her dress, and had on a pretty, blue gown. She carried the flowers in one hand, and with her other hand she held out the hand of the young man.\n\n\"Mrs. Quinney is going to come down in a moment,\" the girl said, \"and I am sure she will be glad to see you. She is a very nice lady, and you will like her very much. I am sure you will. She is a very dear friend of ours.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" the young man said, as he shook hands with the girl, \"I am sure I shall. I am very glad to meet you.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to meet you,\" she answered, as she smiled. \"Mr. Quinney will be glad to meet you, too. Will you wait here until we come out?\"\n\n\"I will wait here,\" the young man said.\n\nA moment later, the girl and the young man were alone. The young man looked quickly at the girl, and, as he gazed at her, it seemed as if he saw her face change.\n\n\"I am sure you will like Mrs. Quinney,\" the girl said, \"and I am sure Mr. Quinney will be glad to meet you, too.\"\n\n\"I am sure he will,\" the young man said, \"I am sure I shall like him, too. I am very glad to meet you.\"\n\n\"It is very pleasant to meet you,\" the girl said, \"and I am sure you will like Mr. Quinney, and Mrs. Quinney, too.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall,\" the young man said. \"I am going to like them very much.\"\n\n\"You will like them very much,\" the girl said.\n\nShe turned and walked quickly into the house. A moment later, the young man heard the sound of footsteps upon the porch, then, the door opened, and a man came out. He was a tall, handsome man, with a well-cut face, and dark hair. As he came out of the door, he smiled in a friendly way.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" he said, as he held out his hand to the young man.\n\"I am very glad to meet you. I am sure you will like us.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to meet you,\" the young man said, as he shook hands with Mr. Quinney. \"I am sure I shall.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will,\" Mr. Quinney said, as he smiled.\n\n\"My daughter tells me that you are looking for me,\" he said, \"and I am very glad to meet you. My wife is out, but she will be home soon, and I am sure you will like her.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall,\" the young man said.\n\n\"You will like her very much,\" Mr. Quinney said. \"You will like her very much.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall,\" the young man said.\n\n\"I am sure you will,\" Mr. Quinney said.\n\n\"I am very glad to meet you,\" the young man said, \"and I am sure I shall like you very much.\"\n\n\"I am sure you will,\" Mr. Quinney said, \"and that you will like my wife very much.\"\n\n\"I am sure I shall,\" the young man said.\n\n\"I am sure you will,\" Mr. Quinney said.\n\nA moment later, the door opened, and a young woman came out. She was a tall, dark-haired woman, with a beautiful, oval face. As she came out of the door, the young man stood up.\n\nMr. Quinney stepped forward quickly.\n\n\"My dear!\" he"

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

What you want to achieve is a `list` environment which is not possible with the `instructions` package (in the sense that a `list` environment does not only have a `start` and `end` counterpart) ...\n\nComment: @UlrikeFischer The `list` environment only has `\\item` etc. instead of `\\insttext`. I'll edit my question to clarify what I'm trying to do.\n\nComment: There are other packages which allow you to define an environment with `\\insttext` as in the `instructions` package. But since the `instructions` package is already in use, you cannot use the same name for your environment (as it would conflict with the `instructions` package).\n\nComment: @UlrikeFischer I'm not sure I understand. I meant that the `list` environment does not have an equivalent of `\\insttext`, which is why I'm trying to do it.\n\nComment: The `\\instinstructions` is an environment which is provided by the `instructions` package. So you cannot have an environment with the same name in your document.\n\nComment: @UlrikeFischer Ah, I see. Is there a way to do this with the `instructions` package, or with a different package?\n\nAnswer: The `instructions` package defines an environment `\\instinstructions` which acts like a `list`. It is possible to nest such environments like\n\n\\begin{code}\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{instructions}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{instructions}\n  \\begin{instinstructions}\n     \\insttext{This is the instruction}\n  \\end{instinstructions}\n\\end{instructions}\n\\end{document}\n\\end{code}\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nComment: I've updated my example to show what I'm trying to do.\n\nComment: @AndrewS. I've updated my answer to show how you could nest such an environment.\n\nAnswer: I think this is what you're looking for:\n\n\\begin{code}\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{instructions}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{instructions}\n\\insttext{This is the instruction}\n\\end{instructions}\n\n\\begin{instructions}[start = \\insttext]\n\\insttext{This is the instruction}\n\\end{instructions}\n\n\\begin{instructions}[start = \\insttext and \\insttext]\n\\insttext{This is the instruction}\n\\end{instructions}\n\n\\begin{instructions}[start = \\insttext, not= \\insttext]\n\\insttext{This is the instruction}\n\\end{instructions}\n\n\\begin{instructions}[start = \\insttext and not = \\insttext]\n\\insttext{This is the instruction}\n\\end{instructions}\n\n\\begin{instructions}[start = \\insttext and \\insttext and not = \\insttext]\n\\insttext{This is the instruction}\n\\end{instructions}\n\\end{document}\n\\end{code}\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nComment: I've updated my example to show what I'm trying to do.\n\nComment: @AndrewS. I've updated my answer.\n\nComment: That's close, but I'd like the `and` to be a separator, not a condition.\n\nComment: @AndrewS. I guess you mean something like `and\\insttext` or `\\insttext and`?\n\nComment: I want the `and` to be a separator.\n\nAnswer: You can create a nested environment, but this is not the best solution. I would suggest to define a list like\n\n\\begin{code}\n\\documentclass{article}\n\n\\newlist{mylist}{enumerate}{1}\n\\setlist[mylist,1]{labelsep = \\insttext}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{mylist}\n\\item This is the first instruction.\n\\item This is the second instruction.\n\\end{mylist}\n\\end{document}\n\\end{code}\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nComment: That's close, but I'd like the `and` to be a condition.\n\nComment: @AndrewS. What do you mean by condition?\n\nComment: I want the `and` to be a separator.\n\nComment: @AndrewS. You can use `\\insttext and` for that.\n\nComment: I want the `and` to be a condition, not a separator.\n\nComment: @AndrewS. I am not sure if I understand you. If you want to set a condition on the first item of the list, you can use `start = \\insttext and`."

But it wasn’t always that way. In ancient times, people were always being washed away by the sea, or being swallowed up by earthquakes, or being frozen by the cold, or being burned up by the sun, and they had to build their cities on high ground so that they wouldn’t be washed away by the sea.

        "res": "In the past several years, there have been many advances in the field of health information technology. These advances have led to increased efficiency in the health care industry and have helped to improve the quality of care provided to patients. In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on the use of electronic health records (EHRs) in order to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of health care.\nElectronic medical records (EMRs) are considered one of the most important advances in health care in recent years. EMRs have the potential to improve the quality of care provided to patients by allowing health care providers to access patient information more quickly and easily. In addition, EMRs can help reduce the cost of health care by reducing the need for paper records and by increasing the efficiency of health care providers.\nThere are many different types of EMRs available on the market today. Each type of EMR has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. It is important for health care providers to carefully consider the different types of EMRs available before making a purchase.\n[TIP] EMRs are a very important part of the health care industry. They are used to track patient information, record patient visits, and store patient data. They also help to improve the quality of care provided to patients. [/TIP]\nEHRs have the potential to transform the health care industry by improving the quality of care and reducing the cost of health care. However, there are also some potential disadvantages of EHRs. One of the biggest disadvantages is that EHRs can be difficult to use. This can lead to frustration among health care providers and patients. In addition, EHRs can be expensive to implement and maintain.\nOverall, EHRs have the potential to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of health care. However, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. Health care providers should carefully consider the different types of EHRs available before making a purchase.\nThe healthcare industry is constantly changing and evolving. As new technologies and advancements are made, it is important for healthcare providers to keep up with the latest trends. One of the most important advancements in recent years is the use of electronic health records (EHRs). These records are a digital version of the paper charts that were previously used in healthcare facilities. EHRs are used to track a patient's medical history, diagnoses, treatment plans, and more.\nEHRs have many benefits over paper charts. They are more secure and easier to access, which can help improve the quality of care. They can also help reduce medical errors and save time and money.\nThe adoption of EHRs has been slow, but there are now more than 90% of hospitals using them. This number is expected to continue to grow in the years ahead. As the healthcare industry continues to evolve, it is important for providers to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and advancements.\nKeywords: [INST: electronic medical records (EMRs), electronic health records (EHRs), health information technology, quality of care, cost of health care, health care providers, health care industry, type of EMRs, different types of EMRs, advantages of EMRs, disadvantages of EMRs]"

Result: A tactical draw, but the British Grand Fleet was saved from the German High Seas Fleet. Commanders: Admiral Sir John Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, Royal Navy, and German Empire. Participants: The British Grand Fleet and German High Seas Fleet, along with the German battlecruisers of the 1st Scouting Group. ================================================= ===Description=== The Battle of Jutland was the largest naval battle of World War I. It was fought by the British and German fleets in the North Sea. It was the only major naval engagement of the war. It took place on 31 May 1916. It was the greatest and last battle fought by the British fleet against the German High Seas Fleet. It was the first battle in which the Royal Navy was defeated in a major engagement. It was also the first time that a British Admiral had ever been defeated in a major fleet engagement. It was the only naval battle fought in the North Sea during the war. The battle began at about 05:00 when the Germans spotted the British fleet. The British fleet was made up of 15 battleships, 9 battlecruisers, 27 cruisers, 67 destroyers, and 12 submarines. The Germans had 19 battleships, 10 battlecruisers, 8 cruisers, and 67 destroyers. The battle lasted for about 10 hours. The British lost about 6,784 men, including 1,415 men killed. The Germans lost about 5,808 men, including 2,551 men killed. The British lost 10 ships, including 2 battleships and 1 battlecruiser. The Germans lost 7 ships, including 1 battleship and 4 cruisers. The battle was not a complete victory for either side. The Germans were able to cause more damage to the British fleet than the British were able to cause to the Germans. However, the British were able to save their fleet from defeat. The British Admiralty called the battle a \"strategic victory\" because the Germans were not able to defeat the British fleet. The Germans called the battle a \"strategic defeat\" because the British Royal Navy was able to save their fleet from defeat. ================================================= ====Comments==== ================================================= ====References==== ================================================= ====External links==== ================================================= <div class=\"references-small\"> <div class=\"references-small\"> <div class=\"references-small\"> [[Category:Campaigns, battles, and sieges|Jutland, Battle of]] [[Category:Naval battles of World War I]] [[Category:Battles of World War I]] [[Category:Battles involving Germany]] [[Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom]] [[Category:1916 in the British Empire]] [[Category:1916 in Germany]] [[Category:Battles of the North Sea]] [[Category:1916 in the North Sea]] </div> </div> </div> [[Category:Battles]] [[Category:Battles of World War I]] [[Category:Naval battles]] [[Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom]] [[Category:Battles involving Germany]] [[Category:History of the Royal Navy]] [[Category:Battles of the North Sea]] [[Category:History of Germany]] [[Category:1916 in the North Sea]]\nReturn to Battle of Jutland.\nRetrieved from \"https://history.state.gov/index.php/Battle_of_Jutland\""

I don't know this book. However, I'd like to make a suggestion or two for you.\nIf you're planning to learn the vocabulary, then you should use the book as it is. However, if you're planning to use it simply as a reading book (and not as a vocabulary book), then you should translate all the vocabulary and make the original word appear in English.\nOne more thing: I'm not sure why you want to ask English teachers to read your book and give you their feedback. This is a forum for language learners, not for teachers. I'm sorry if I'm mistaken, but that's the impression I'm getting.\nThank you so much, Sara.\nI'm not sure why you want to ask English teachers to read your book and give you their feedback.\nYes, that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm not a native English speaker (I'm a Brazilian), and I'm not sure if the English I wrote is understandable. I'm hoping English teachers will be able to read my book and understand what I'm trying to say.\nI'm sorry if I'm mistaken, but that's the impression I'm getting.\nThat's okay. I understand that you could be mistaken.\nI have a question about the English translation. I'm using the book as my own and I'm translating the English words, but I'm not sure if I'm translating them right. I'm not sure if some of the English words are correct.\nI'm not sure if some of the English words are correct.\nI'm sorry I can't be of much help here. I'm not a native English speaker. I can only suggest you study some basic English grammar and then try to translate the words yourself.\nIt's really hard to say if the English words I'm translating are correct or not.\nI'll try to study some basic English grammar and see if I can do it myself.\nThank you for your help.

doesn't seem to work very well for me.\nI've tried to make a challenge, and I tried sharing it via the Strava App, but that didn't work either.\nI'm pretty sure that the Strava app doesn't work on my phone, as it doesn’t have a Strava app.\nSo I'm just wondering if anyone has any experience with Strava, and if so, what would be the best way to create an effective challenge?\nI'd be happy to share my experience with anyone who is interested.\nI'll also be happy to share any tips or advice that anyone has for me.\nThanks for reading, and thanks to everyone who has left a comment!\ndesign

I'm interested in setting up a Telegram channel for a friendly group. I'm pretty much stuck with whatever name you can suggest, so any suggestions would be appreciated.\n1. Pandora's Box (I know it's a bit cliché but I've always liked the name)\n2. Shadow of a Doubt (My favourite Hitchcock movie, I just want to see what you think of it)\n3. The Third Man (Also my favourite film by Carol Reed, it's a reference to the film's title song, which is one of my all-time favourite songs)\n4. The Last Laugh (Also a reference to the song, the movie is about a stand-up comic who's about to kill himself and his last laugh is his last performance)\n5. The Conversation (One of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion)\nI'm open to more suggestions too, so no need to be shy\nEdited June 16, 2016 by Chubak\nI'd suggest something more like \"The Last Laugh\" or \"The Conversation\" if you are using them as an inspiration.\n10 hours ago, Chubak said:\nThe Last Laugh (Also a reference to the song, the movie is about a stand-up comic who's about to kill himself and his last laugh is his last performance)\nEdited June 16, 2016 by Toby\nI agree it should be more like the movie titles.\nThe Last Laugh (referring to the movie)\nThe Conversation (referring to the movie)\nThe Third Man (referring to the movie)\nPandora's Box (I would not like to be associated with that name)\nShadow of a Doubt (I would not like to be associated with that name)\nEdited June 16, 2016 by pigman"
