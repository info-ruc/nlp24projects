        "res": "[INST] The benefits of crowdsourcing projects have been widely recognized, but it is important to consider the potential drawbacks. One of the main concerns is that collaborating on a project can lead to a lack of ownership and control. In crowdsourcing, multiple individuals from different backgrounds and experiences may contribute to a project, and it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for any problems that arise. This can lead to a lack of accountability and a lack of ownership of the final product.\nAnother concern is that crowdsourcing can lead to a lack of diversity. In crowdsourcing, individuals are often selected based on their specific skills and expertise, which can lead to a homogeneous group of contributors. This can result in a lack of diversity in perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds, which can limit the creativity and innovation of the project.\n[INST] To mitigate these concerns, it is important to establish clear guidelines and expectations for collaboration on a crowdsourcing project. This can include setting specific roles and responsibilities for each individual contributor, establishing clear communication channels, and ensuring that all contributors have a sense of ownership and accountability for the project. Additionally, it is important to encourage a diverse group of contributors and to prioritize inclusivity and diversity in the selection process.\nOverall, while there are potential drawbacks to crowdsourcing, it is a powerful tool for collaboration and innovation. By establishing clear guidelines and expectations for collaboration, and prioritizing diversity and inclusivity, we can ensure that the benefits of crowdsourcing projects outweigh the potential drawbacks.\n[INST] Crowdsourcing projects are a powerful tool for collaboration and innovation, but it is important to consider the potential drawbacks.

In crowdsourcing, multiple individuals from different backgrounds and experiences may contribute to a project, and it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for any problems that arise. This can lead to a lack of accountability and a lack of ownership of the final product.\n[INST] To mitigate these concerns, it is important to establish clear guidelines and expectations for collaboration on a crowdsourcing project. This can include setting specific roles and responsibilities for each individual contributor, establishing clear communication channels, and ensuring that all contributors have a sense of ownership and accountability for the project.

        "res": "We have a new model of a [Ventilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilator) and we would like to be able to extract relevant data (i.e. information) from the internet and combine it with the data we have about our ventilator. I've been searching for a while but haven't found anything that would be suitable for this task.\n\nI've been looking into [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), but I can't seem to find the right resources for this task.\n\nI'm looking for an answer to the following questions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What are some good resources for NLP?\n\\item What about NLP for medical data?\n\\item What about NLP for product data?\n\\item What about NLP for product data that's in [PDF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format)?\n\\item What about NLP for product data that's in [XML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI'm really interested in creating an application that can extract relevant information from textual data and combine it with the data we have about our ventilator.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nComment: You should be aware that Stack Overflow is a site for programming questions. Many of the answers will be for programming solutions rather than NLP (or at least for programming solutions that will provide the data you need).\n\nAnswer: I don't know where you're going to start (I'm guessing you're a developer), but I'll give you some pointers.\n\nFirst, you need to learn something about natural language processing, which is a huge subject. I'd recommend starting with the [NLTK tutorial](http://www.nltk.org/book/). If you're interested in medical data, you'll probably want to learn something about [biomedical text mining](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2927233/).\n\nThe first step to any natural language processing task is to get some good data. There are a lot of datasets available for NLP, but not all of them are good for extracting information. You'll probably want to start small, with something like the [20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) dataset. You might want to start with a dataset that contains only information about the ventilator. You could find something like that on the [Semantic Scholar](http://www.semanticscholar.org/) site.\n\nIf you want to be able to extract information from PDF and XML files, you'll probably want to start with [PDFTK](http://www.pdftk.com/), which is a [wrapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_wrapper) for the [PDF toolkit](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdf-toolkit/). You'll find that the NLTK tutorial isn't very XML-friendly, so you'll probably want to learn [XSLT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT).\n\nAnswer: I don't know if I can answer all your questions but let me try to help.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Have a look at Apache Solr. It's a search engine which performs really well. It has a lot of plugins which allow you to deal with medical data.\n\\item I'm not sure whether that is what you are looking for.\n\\item You can use the [Stanford NLP toolkit](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software.shtml), which is also Java based.\n\\item I think you can do this with Stanford NLP or Apache Solr.\n\\item You can always use [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) to extract data from PDFs.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: There are many [resources](https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C1GGRV_enIN731IN731&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=natural%20language%20processing%20books) for NLP.\n\nFor medical data, there is [BioNLP](http://www.bionlp.org/) and [Semantic Scholar](http://www.semanticscholar.org/), both of which have their own [datasets](http://www.semanticscholar.org/browse/dataset).\n\nFor product data, you can look at [this](http://dokken.net/blog/2012/03/17/product-search-and-recommendation-with-natural-language-processing-and-deep-learning/), [this](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/perform-natural-language-processing-with-mongodb-and-python/) and [this](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-1008natural/)\n\nFor PDF, you can look at [PDFTK](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) and [PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org/)\n\nFor XML, there is [JAXB](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxb/intro/index.html) for Java.\n\nAnswer: For the NLP part, you can use the Apache Stanford NLP library: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software.shtml\n\nThe library has a wrapper for Java, but you'll need to add the core library to your project.\n\nFor the XML and PDF part, you can use the Apache Tika library: https://tika.apache.org/\n\nI think these two should be enough to get you started."

I'm guilty of it.\nThat's why I've been thinking about this idea of using random, yet coherent, text as filler content within your Word document.\nYou know the kind of text I'm talking about...\nThe kind that's there to fill space.\nBut you can use it in a subtle way that doesn't disrupt the flow of the document.\nThe idea came from a book I read by Stephen King.\nFor those of you who don't know, Stephen King is a famous author.\nI'm not a big fan of his books.\nBut I do like this one book he wrote called 'On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft'.\nI highly recommend it if you're an aspiring author.\nStephen King's book really helped me to improve my style of writing.\nBut the one thing that really stuck with me was this one quote that he said:\n\"If you've read many Stephen King novels, you know that I tend to bury a lot of story in a sentence. Some might even call it a habit. This is not necessarily a good thing. The idea is that a writer should be able to tell a complete story in a single sentence, but if he or she can't, then at least he or she should be able to tell a part of a story in a sentence.

It can make us feel happy, sad, angry, nostalgic, motivated, and much much more.\nMany of us are familiar with the concept of a “vibe.” In this case, a vibe is simply the emotion a song makes us feel.\nSo, let’s put these two things together:\nHow do we make a song list that is curated based on the vibe of the songs in that list?\nWe can use Spotify to do that.\nSpotify has a feature called “Moods,” which is a collection of playlists that are curated based on a specific mood or vibe.\nFor example, here’s a mood that is based on the emotion “Happy”:\nBut what if we want a similar list that is based on the vibe of a song? For example, what if we want a list that is based on the mood of the song “Dance Monkey” by Tones and I?\nWhat we can do is create a playlist that is curated based on a vibe, and publish that playlist to the world as a song list.\nIn other words, we can use Spotify to curate playlists based on vibes, and then we can publish those playlists to the world as song lists.\nWe’ll call this process “curated music lists.”\nThe process for making curated music lists is relatively simple:\nCreate a playlist in Spotify that is curated based on a vibe.\nPublish that playlist to the world as a song list.\nHere’s how you can do that.\nStep 1: Create a playlist in Spotify that is curated based on the vibe of a song.\nThe first step is to create a playlist in Spotify that is curated based on the vibe of a song.\nTo create a playlist in Spotify, just click on the “Playlists” tab at the top of the Spotify app and then click on the “+” button in the top-right corner:\nOnce you’ve clicked on the “+” button, you’ll be brought to a new screen where you can start adding songs to your playlist.\nTo create a playlist that is curated based on the vibe of a song, you’ll need to create a playlist that is curated based on a certain mood or vibe.\nAs we mentioned earlier, Spotify has a feature called “Moods,” which is a collection of playlists that are curated based on a specific mood or vibe.\nFor example, here’s a mood that is based on the emotion “Happy”:\nIf you don’t want to use Spotify’s “Moods” feature to curate your playlist, then you can just create a playlist based on the vibe of a song.\nFor example, if you want a curated playlist that is based on the vibe of the song “Dance Monkey” by Tones and I, then you can just create a playlist that is curated based on the vibe of that song:\nOnce you’ve created your playlist, click on the “Done” button in the top-right corner:\nNow, your playlist is ready to use!\nStep 2: Publish your playlist to the world as a song list.\nThe second step is to publish your playlist to the world as a song list.\nTo publish your playlist to the world as a song list, just click on the “Publish” button in the top-right corner:\nOnce you’ve clicked on the “Publish” button, you’ll be brought to a new screen where you can choose to publish your playlist as a song list:\nWhen you publish your playlist as a song list, you’ll be prompted to give your song list a name:\nOnce you’ve given your song list a name, you’ll be prompted to choose a cover image for your song list:\nOnce you’ve chosen a cover image for your song list, you’ll be prompted to choose a description for your song list:\nOnce you’ve chosen a description for your song list, you’ll be prompted to choose a privacy setting for your song list:\nOnce you’ve chosen a privacy setting for your song list, your song list will be published to the world!\nYou may also need to edit the name and cover image of the song list, depending on the privacy setting that you chose.\nFor example, if you chose to make your song list public, then anyone will be able to see the name and cover image of your song list.\nBut if you chose to make your song list private, then only people who follow you on Spotify will be able to see the name and cover image of your song list.\nTo edit the name and cover image of your song list, just click on the “Edit” button that is next to the name and cover image of your song list:\nOnce you’ve clicked on the “Edit” button, you’ll be prompted to choose a name and cover image for your song list:\nOnce you’ve chosen a name and cover image for your song list, you’ll be prompted to choose a privacy setting for your song list:\nOnce you’ve chosen a privacy setting for your song list, your song list will be updated with the new name and cover image.\nCongratulations! You now have a curated playlist that is based on the vibe of a song.\nNow, let’s take a look at how you can use this playlist as a song list.\nStep 3: Use your playlist as a song list.\nThe third and final step is to use your playlist as a song list.\nTo use your playlist as a song list, just click on the “Listen” button in the top-right corner:\nOnce you’ve clicked on the “Listen” button, you’ll be brought to a new screen where you can play your song list:\nYou can play your song list by clicking on the play button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also pause your song list by clicking on the pause button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also skip to the next song in your song list by clicking on the next button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also skip to the previous song in your song list by clicking on the previous button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also shuffle your song list by clicking on the shuffle button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next track of your song list by clicking on the next track button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous track of your song list by clicking on the previous track button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next album of your song list by clicking on the next album button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous album of your song list by clicking on the previous album button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next artist of your song list by clicking on the next artist button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous artist of your song list by clicking on the previous artist button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next genre of your song list by clicking on the next genre button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous genre of your song list by clicking on the previous genre button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next album of your song list by clicking on the next album button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous album of your song list by clicking on the previous album button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next artist of your song list by clicking on the next artist button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous artist of your song list by clicking on the previous artist button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next genre of your song list by clicking on the next genre button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous genre of your song list by clicking on the previous genre button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next artist of your song list by clicking on the next artist button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous artist of your song list by clicking on the previous artist button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next album of your song list by clicking on the next album button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous album of your song list by clicking on the previous album button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next genre of your song list by clicking on the next genre button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the previous genre of your song list by clicking on the previous genre button that is next to the song list:\nYou can also go to the next artist of your song list by clicking on the next artist button that is next to the song list:"

With the OneLove band we express this message,” said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.\n“On behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now. It is good to see that other countries are joining this initiative.”\nOneLove was founded in the Netherlands in 2020 to emphasize that all football fans have at least one thing in common – their love of football – and to speak out against any form of discrimination.\nAs well as focusing on public messaging, the initiative has also developed to offer diversity training to grassroots club.\n“Our love of football unites us all. No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,” said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n“I am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.”\nIn June, England’s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark’s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n“I am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,” he said on Tuesday.\n“As captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.”",

Thematic tweets can be used to promote a company’s products or services, share industry insights, or simply provide valuable content to a target audience.\nOne of the key benefits of a thematic tweet is that it allows companies to quickly and effectively communicate important information to their followers. With a simple click of a button, companies can share news and facts that are relevant to their audience, which can help to build brand awareness and trust.\nAnother benefit of a thematic tweet is that it allows companies to share multiple pieces of information in a single message. This can be especially useful for companies that need to quickly provide updates or new information to their followers.\nIn addition to being a useful communication tool, a thematic tweet can also be a valuable marketing tool. By targeting specific audiences with relevant information, companies can increase their chances of capturing the attention of potential customers.\nThere are several types of thematic tweets that companies can use to share company news and facts. One type of thematic tweet is a product or service launch tweet. This type of tweet is designed to announce the launch of a new product or service and provide information about its features and benefits.\nAnother type of thematic tweet is an industry news tweet. This type of tweet is designed to share important industry news and insights with a target audience. Companies can use this type of tweet to demonstrate their expertise and build trust with their followers.\nAnother type of thematic tweet is a customer testimonial tweet.

        "res": "This article is about the top 10 social media trends that will dominate the industry in 2023. It outlines the key areas of focus for social media marketers and provides examples of how brands are leveraging these trends to drive engagement and conversion. The article emphasizes that staying up-to-date with the latest social media trends is crucial for success in the fast-paced world of digital marketing.\nSocial media has become an essential part of our daily lives, and the industry is constantly evolving with new trends emerging every year. In 2023, social media marketers should be aware of the latest trends to stay ahead of the curve and effectively reach their target audience.\nHere are the top 10 social media trends that will dominate the industry in 2023: [LIST]\n1. Increased emphasis on visual content\nSocial media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are known for their emphasis on visual content, and this trend is expected to continue in 2023. Visual content, such as images, GIFs, and videos, is more engaging and memorable than text-based content, and it's easier to create and share on social media. With the rise of platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok, brands will need to produce and share more visual content to stay relevant.\n2. The rise of virtual and augmented reality\nVirtual and augmented reality technologies are becoming increasingly popular, and social media platforms are beginning to integrate them into their offerings. Brands can use virtual and augmented reality to create immersive experiences for their audience, such as virtual events, product demonstrations, and virtual tours.\n3. Increased focus on live streaming\nLive streaming has become a popular way for brands to connect with their audience in real-time. Platforms like Instagram Live, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live allow brands to broadcast their events, product launches, and behind-the-scenes content, and they can also interact with their audience in real-time. Live streaming is an effective way to build brand awareness and engage with your audience.\n4. The rise of influencer marketing\nInfluencer marketing has become one of the most popular ways for brands to reach their target audience on social media. Influencers have a large following on social media and can help brands reach a wider audience by promoting their products or services. As the importance of social media continues to grow, influencer marketing is expected to become an even more significant part of brands' marketing strategies.\n5. Personalization and targeting\nSocial media platforms are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to personalize and target content to their users. Brands can use social media platforms' targeting and personalization features to deliver relevant, tailored content to their audience. This can help brands build stronger relationships with their audience and drive more engagement with their content.\n6. The rise of e-commerce on social media\nSocial media platforms are becoming more and more integrated with e-commerce capabilities, allowing brands to sell their products directly on the platform. This trend is expected to continue in 2023, as social media platforms invest in e-commerce capabilities and brands look for new ways to monetize their social media presence.\n7. The rise of social commerce\nSocial commerce is the practice of selling products or services directly on social media platforms. This trend is expected to continue in 2023, as social media platforms continue to invest in e-commerce capabilities and brands look for new ways to monetize their social media presence. Social commerce is an effective way for brands to drive sales and build a strong relationship with their audience.\n8. Increased focus on data and analytics\nSocial media platforms are investing in data and analytics capabilities to help brands better understand their audience and optimize their marketing strategies. Brands can use these tools to track metrics like engagement, reach, and conversions, and to create targeted campaigns that are more effective and efficient.\n9. The rise of AI and machine learning\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are becoming increasingly important in social media marketing. Brands can use these technologies to automate tasks like content creation, targeting, and analytics, allowing them to save time and focus on more strategic activities. AI and machine learning can also help brands personalize their content and deliver more relevant, targeted messaging to their audience.\n10. The rise of voice search\nVoice search is becoming more prevalent on social media platforms like Google, Amazon, and Apple, and it's expected to continue growing in popularity in 2023. Brands can optimize their content for voice search by incorporating longer-tail keywords, using natural language, and structuring their content to be more accessible to voice assistants.\nIn conclusion, social media is a constantly evolving and dynamic industry, and brands must stay up-to-date with the latest trends to stay relevant and effective. The top 10 social media trends for 2023 include increased emphasis on visual content, the rise of virtual and augmented reality, the rise of e-commerce on social media, the rise of social commerce, increased focus on data and analytics, the rise of AI and machine learning, the rise of voice search, and personalization and targeting.

        "res": "In today’s digital age, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become increasingly widespread in many industries. As these technologies continue to evolve and become more advanced, they have the potential to transform the way we approach tasks and make decisions in various fields.\nOne such field that has already seen significant benefits from the use of AI and ML is healthcare. With the help of these technologies, healthcare providers have been able to improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency in a number of ways.\nIn this article, we will explore the various ways in which AI and ML are being used in healthcare, including diagnosis and treatment planning, risk prediction, patient engagement, and healthcare operations.\nDiagnosis and Treatment Planning\nOne of the most significant benefits of AI and ML in healthcare is their ability to improve the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans. By analyzing vast amounts of data, these technologies can identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to human healthcare providers. For example, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly than a human radiologist. Similarly, ML algorithms can analyze patient health data to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes, such as the risk of developing a certain disease or the likelihood of a patient responding to a particular treatment.\nRisk prediction is an important aspect of healthcare, as it can help healthcare providers identify and prioritize patients who are at a higher risk of developing certain diseases or experiencing adverse health outcomes. By leveraging the power of AI and ML, risk prediction algorithms can be trained on vast amounts of patient data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to human healthcare providers. For example, an AI algorithm might analyze a patient’s genetic information, lifestyle factors, and health history to predict their risk of developing certain diseases or experiencing adverse health outcomes.\nIn addition to improving the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans, AI and ML can also increase patient engagement in their own healthcare. For example, by providing patients with personalized information and recommendations based on their individual health data, healthcare providers can help patients take a more active role in their own care. For example, an ML algorithm might analyze a patient’s health data to identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to a human healthcare provider and provide personalized recommendations for lifestyle changes or treatment options.\nFinally, AI and ML can also be used to improve healthcare operations, such as scheduling and billing. By analyzing vast amounts of data, these technologies can identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent to human healthcare providers and recommend more efficient ways of doing things. For example, an ML algorithm might analyze patient health data to identify the most effective treatment options and recommend more efficient scheduling of appointments.\nIn conclusion, AI and ML are transforming healthcare by improving patient outcomes, reducing costs, and increasing efficiency. By leveraging the power of these technologies, healthcare providers can provide more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, identify and prioritize patients who are at a higher risk of developing certain diseases or experiencing adverse health outcomes, increase patient engagement in their own care, and improve healthcare operations. As these technologies continue to evolve and become more advanced, they have the potential to transform healthcare even further and improve the lives of patients around the world.\nTags: #Artificial

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride.

Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the course you may want to come back and look at these materials. This section should not take you an entire week.\n- Installing and Using Python\nIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.\n- Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)\nIn the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\n- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions\nIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.\n- Chapter Three: Conditional Code\nIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.",

It's mainly made from recycled parts.\nWhen a 1.5 volt battery is new it will probably have more than 1.5 volts in it. As the battery is used the voltage will decrease until the voltage is not enough to run the application ( E.g. a red LED) and will be called 'dead' . But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage. The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit. The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.\nHere is the required steps:\n1- Connect a switch to a battery holder. A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.\n2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.\n3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.\n4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts)\n5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts)\n6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.\n7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.\n8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up.",

Of course, you have to be able to develop the idea as well but if you can’t come up with an idea, there’s no point in trying to develop it.\nHowever, there are some obstacles that you will have to overcome in thinking up a business idea. In this article, I will share a few things to consider in coming up with a business idea.\nIt is important to be able to think of an idea that you can actually make money from. This means that you have to think about something that you can sell to people, either online or offline. If you have a hobby or a passion, you can think of ways to monetize it. If you like cooking, you can start a food business. If you like baking, you can make cupcakes and sell them to people.\nIf you can’t think of ideas that can generate revenue, you can think of something that will help you solve a problem. If you can solve a problem, you can make money out of it. If you can solve a problem that a lot of other people have, you can make a lot of money.\nIt is important to be able to think of an idea that is unique. If you can’t think of a unique idea, you can think of something that is not yet available in the market. You can think of an idea that is a variation of an existing idea and make it better.\nIt is important to be able to think of an idea that is not yet available in the market.

        "output": "Step 1: Close Drink Opening\nTo build up steam the beverage can needs to act as a pressure vessel and so needs to be completely sealed, except where the steam will come out of the jet nozzles. It also needs to rotate on itself. Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can. This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can.",

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it.",

For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.\nPreheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nScoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.\nBake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.\nCool completely before serving.",

First of all, there is already a Recipe Thread, which is not limited to vegan recipes. Second, it's a forum, not a recipe thread. Third, it's a recipe thread, not a dessert recipe thread.\nBecause most of us don't live in America, we don't know what you're talking about, nor do we know where to get these ingredients.\nThe idea behind this suggestion is to allow people to suggest their own vegan dessert recipes and make it easier for others to find them.\nI guess it's not that hard to find vegan dessert recipes, if you search. But it's nice to have them in one place, and it's even better to be able to suggest them.\nI think this suggestion is a good one. I've often wanted to share a new recipe, and I've often wondered if there was a good place to share vegan recipes. I've never seen a recipe thread that is limited to vegan recipes, so I think this is a great idea.\nI think this is a good idea.

Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.",

If we look more closely, we see that once we satisfy the second inequality, the first is redundant. (If x>12, then it must already be larger than zero.)\nNow, in order for this statement to be true, we need that if x solves either of the assumptions, then it must solve x>12.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

The survey included questions about the students’ academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and personal characteristics. The researchers also conducted interviews with a smaller sample of high-achieving students to gain additional insights. The study found that high-achieving students were generally more involved in extracurricular activities, had higher levels of academic achievement, and were more likely to be engaged in their studies than their peers. The study also found that high-achieving students were more likely to be involved in leadership roles and to have access to resources that supported their academic success.

        "context": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

It’s often better to improve the quality of the content vs maximizing the quantity – in this case it may have made more sense to remove some pieces and reduce the use of acronyms",

Add bell pepper and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.\nAdd chicken, garlic, and next 6 ingredients; cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink and just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Stir in beans, tomatoes, and cilantro (if using). Season with salt and pepper.\nServe stew over rice, if desired.\nChicken is a lean meat, good for you!\nThanks for your recipe. I'll be sure to use this the next time I make chicken stew.\nDo you mind creating a new recipe using these ingredients?\nI've never tried chicken stew before and I'm interested in trying out a new recipe.\nI've actually got a couple of recipes that use these ingredients. First one is this:\n1 chicken breast with skin\n1/2 cups of white wine\n1/2 cup of chopped white onion\n1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms\n1/4 cup fresh chopped garlic\n1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley\n1 cup of chopped fresh chives\n1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).\n2. Place chicken breast in baking dish. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and garlic powder over chicken. Pour white wine into dish.\n3. Place dish in oven and let it bake for 45 minutes.\n4. Remove baking dish from oven. Add mushrooms to dish and let it bake for 15 minutes.\n5. Remove baking dish from oven. Add chopped parsley, chives, and garlic to dish and stir.\n6. Remove chicken from baking dish and shred it with a fork.\n7. Place shredded chicken and mushrooms back into baking dish.\n8. Pour olive oil into dish and stir.\n9. Serve chicken stew with rice.\nThe second recipe is this one:\n1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).\n2. Prepare a 9x13 inch baking pan by spraying it with cooking oil or butter.\n3. Heat some oil in a large skillet. Add the chicken and brown it on both sides. Set aside.\n4. Add the onion, garlic, and celery to the skillet and sauté until softened.\n5. Add the flour, salt, and pepper and mix well. Add the broth and mix well.\n6. Add the chicken and mushrooms and mix well. Pour the contents of the skillet into the prepared pan.\n7. Sprinkle with the thyme and parsley.\n8. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown.\n9. Serve with a side of rice.\nReactions: Panda and kitty\nThanks for your recipes.\nThe first one looks great. I think I will try making this in the future for dinner.\nThe second recipe looks interesting. I'm unfamiliar with the term \"stew\" but will try to make this in the future for dinner.\nDo you mind creating a new recipe using these ingredients? I will be more than happy to try out your recipes.\nReactions: kitty\nHi, I don't have any meals I have prepared with these ingredients, but I do have a few suggestions.\nIngredient #1 - Rice.\nThe following recipe is from a food magazine I receive. It is very good.\nTeriyaki Chicken with Rice\n1/4 cup dry white wine or white vermouth\n1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into\n1 tablespoon soy sauce (or 2 teaspoons Asian-style soy sauce)\n2 teaspoons mirin (or white wine)\n1-2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil\n2. In a small bowl, combine the wine, soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil.\n3. Prepare a small baking dish by spraying it with cooking oil or butter.\n4. In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water.\n5. Heat some oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and brown it on both sides.\n6. Coat each chicken piece with the sauce mixture. Set aside.\n7. In a large pot, bring the broth to a boil. Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender, about 20-25 minutes.\n8. Stir in the soy sauce mixture.\n9. Return the chicken to the pot and stir until the chicken is cooked through.\n10. Serve the chicken with the rice.\nIngredient #2 - Chicken Thighs.\nChicken Thighs with Couscous\n1/2 cup dried currants\n2 teaspoons honey (or 1/2 cup of honey)\n1/2 teaspoon ground allspice (or 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon)\n1. In a small bowl, combine the currants, honey, allspice, and cinnamon.\n2. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan.\n3. Add the couscous and stir well with a fork. Cover the saucepan and remove it from the heat. Let it stand for 10 minutes.\n4. Strain the couscous and set aside.\n5. Heat some oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
