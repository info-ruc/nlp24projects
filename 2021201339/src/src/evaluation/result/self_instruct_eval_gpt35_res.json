With the OneLove band we express this message,” said Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain.\n“On behalf of the Dutch team I have been wearing this band for quite a while now. It is good to see that other countries are joining this initiative.”\nOneLove was founded in the Netherlands in 2020 to emphasize that all football fans have at least one thing in common – their love of football – and to speak out against any form of discrimination.\nAs well as focusing on public messaging, the initiative has also developed to offer diversity training to grassroots club.\n“Our love of football unites us all. No matter where you come from, what you look like and who you love. Football is there for everyone and our sport must stand up for the people across the world who face discrimination and exclusion,” said Germany captain Manuel Neuer.\n“I am proud to be sending out this message with my colleagues from the other national teams. Every single voice counts.”\nIn June, England’s captain Harry Kane revealed that he had discussed taking a collective stance regarding human rights in Qatar with Denmark’s Christian Eriksen and France captain Hugo Lloris.\n“I am honored to join my fellow national team captains in supporting the important OneLove campaign,” he said on Tuesday.\n“As captains we may all be competing against each other on the pitch, but we stand together against all forms of discrimination. This is even more relevant at a time when division is common in society. Wearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching.”",

The murder weapon, a knife, is found at the crime scene, but the suspect claims they are innocent and have an alibi for the time of the murder. The town is divided, with some believing the suspect is guilty and others believing they are being framed.\n\nStory:\n\nAs I arrived in the small town, the tension in the air was palpable. The murder of the beloved business owner had shaken the community to its core, and everyone seemed to have an opinion on who was guilty. I made my way to the crime scene, a quaint little shop on the main street, and began my investigation.\n\nThe evidence was damning. The murder weapon, a bloodied knife, was found at the scene, and the business partner, Mark, had been the last person to see the victim alive. But as I interviewed Mark, something didn't quite add up. His alibi was solid, and he seemed genuinely shocked and distraught by the news of the murder.\n\nI decided to dig deeper, speaking to the employees of the shop and the locals who frequented it. As I pieced together their accounts, a different picture began to emerge. It seemed that the victim and Mark had been at odds for months, each accusing the other of embezzling money from the business. The tension between the two had been building, and it was no secret that they had a strained relationship.\n\nArmed with this new information, I delved into the victim's financial records and uncovered discrepancies that pointed to someone else being involved in the embezzlement. It seemed that the victim's wife had been siphoning off funds from the business for months, and when the victim had discovered her betrayal, a violent argument had ensued.\n\nAs I presented my findings to the town, the tide of public opinion began to shift. The evidence against Mark crumbled, and the focus turned to the victim's wife. With the pressure mounting, she soon confessed to the murder, unable to live with the guilt of what she had done. The truth had finally come to light, and justice was served in the small town once more."

In various cultures and religious traditions, myths and creation stories have been used to explain the origins of the world and humanity.\n\nThroughout history, the study of origins has been a key focus in various fields, including philosophy, anthropology, archaeology, and biology. The scientific revolution of the 17th century led to a significant shift in understanding the origins of the natural world, with the development of theories such as the Big Bang and evolution.\n\nIn contemporary usage, the word \"origins\" is commonly used to refer to the source or starting point of something, whether it be a person's ancestry, the history of a concept or idea, or the development of a particular tradition or practice.

Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence.

Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.\nImporting firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of employment and commercial law. Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of goods made using slave labour to minimum price support schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. Non-governmental organizations also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.

        "res": "The Battle of Gettysburg was a crucial turning point in the American Civil War. It took place from July 1-3, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The battle saw the Union Army, led by General George Meade, face off against the Confederate Army, led by General Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe battle began when Confederate forces clashed with Union cavalry on the outskirts of Gettysburg. Over the next three days, the two armies engaged in intense fighting, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The battle culminated in Pickett's Charge, a doomed Confederate assault on the center of the Union lines, which resulted in a devastating defeat for the Confederates.\n\nThe Union victory at Gettysburg marked a major turning point in the war. It was the first time that General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had been decisively defeated, and it gave the Union a much-needed morale boost. The battle also ended Confederate hopes of gaining recognition from European powers, such as Britain and France, which had been considering intervening in the war on the side of the South.\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg is often cited as the turning point in the Civil War because it effectively ended Confederate hopes of achieving a military victory and shifted the momentum in favor of the Union. After the battle, the Confederate army was forced to retreat to Virginia, and they never again posed a serious threat to Union territory in the North.\n\nThe significance of Gettysburg is further underscored by President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery just a few months after the battle. In his speech, Lincoln eloquently expressed the idea that the Union's cause was worth fighting for and that the sacrifice of the soldiers who died at Gettysburg should not be forgotten.\n\nIn conclusion, the Battle of Gettysburg was a pivotal moment in the Civil War, with far-reaching implications for the outcome of the conflict. Its significance extends beyond the military sphere, as it also played a crucial role in shaping the broader historical and cultural legacy of the United States."

This section should not take you an entire week.\n- Installing and Using Python\nIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.\n- Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)\nIn the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\n- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions\nIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.\n- Chapter Three: Conditional Code\nIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved.",

It also needs to rotate on itself. Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can. This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can.",

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it.",

This exercise helps bring your focus back to the present moment and can reduce feelings of anxiety.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- Look around and identify 5 things you can see. Pay close attention to the details of each item.\n- Notice 4 things you can feel, such as the texture of your clothes, the temperature of the air, or the sensation of the ground beneath your feet.\n- Listen for 3 things you can hear, whether it's the sound of traffic outside, birds chirping, or the hum of a fan.\n- Identify 2 things you can smell. This could be the scent of your surroundings, a familiar fragrance, or even the smell of fresh air.\n- Finally, find 1 thing you can taste. This might be the lingering taste of a recent meal, a mint, or simply the natural taste in your mouth.\n\nBy engaging your senses in this way, you redirect your focus away from anxiety-inducing thoughts and towards the present moment. This can help ground you and reduce the intensity of the anxiety you are feeling. Practicing this exercise regularly can also help develop a mindfulness habit, which can be beneficial for managing anxiety in the long term."

For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.\nPreheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nScoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.\nBake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.\nCool completely before serving.",

Modern astronomy has provided overwhelming evidence supporting the fact that the Earth revolves around the Sun, including the observation of the apparent motion of the Sun across the sky, the changing position of stars throughout the year, and the gravitational influence of the Sun on the orbits of planets. Additionally, space exploration and satellite technology have provided further confirmation of the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

        "context": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

These towns offer charming Main Streets, local shops and restaurants, and access to outdoor activities like rock climbing and zip-lining.\n\nFurther along the route, I would suggest a stop at Linville Gorge, known as the \"Grand Canyon of the East,\" for more hiking and breathtaking views. Continuing on the Blue Ridge Parkway, I would recommend a stop at Grandfather Mountain, where visitors can hike, cross the Mile High Swinging Bridge, and see a diverse array of wildlife.\n\nFinally, the road trip could end in the town of Chimney Rock, which offers the opportunity to hike to the top of Chimney Rock itself and enjoy panoramic views of Lake Lure and the surrounding mountains.\n\nThis road trip would offer the perfect combination of natural beauty, outdoor activities, and small town charm for someone who enjoys nature and hiking."
