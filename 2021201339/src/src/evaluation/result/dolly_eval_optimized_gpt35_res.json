Kerfoot has been the majority owner of the Whitecaps since 2002, when he saved the club from contraction after previous owner David Stadnyk left the club, selling it to United Soccer Leagues. Mallett, a former chief operating officer (COO) of Yahoo!, who was raised in Victoria, British Columbia, and played for several collegiate soccer teams. He later purchased minority stakes in the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball and English soccer club Derby County F.C. Having first met at a charity soccer event in 2005, Mallett partnered with Steve Nash—a two-time National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player who was also raised in Victoria—to put together a bid for a minority share of English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in 2008. After that transaction fell through, the duo contacted Kerfoot about a minority stake in the club. Nash is the older brother of former Whitecaps midfielder Martin Nash. The fourth partner, Steve Luczo, is the president, chairman, and CEO of Seagate Technology and a partner in Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., a group who own the NBA Boston Celtics. Luczo met Kerfoot while the two were both employed by Seagate Technology, and Kerfoot contacted Luczo proposing he become part of the club's MLS bid. In 2009, the group paid a $35 million expansion fee to MLS for the right to join the league.",

        "context": "The new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. At this stage, the new operating system was a singletasking operating system, not a multitasking one such as Multics. The name Unics (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, pronounced as \"eunuchs\"), a pun on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services), was initially suggested for the project in 1970. Brian Kernighan claims the coining for himself, and adds that \"no one can remember\" who came up with the final spelling Unix. Dennis Ritchie and Doug McIlroy also credit Kernighan.\n\nWhen the Computing Sciences Research Center wanted to use Unix on a machine larger than the PDP-7, while another department needed a word processor, Thompson and Ritchie added text processing capabilities to Unix and received funding for a PDP-11. For the first time in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11. A text-formatting program called roff and a text editor were added. All three were written in PDP-11 assembly language. Bell Labs used this initial text-processing system, consisting of Unix, roff, and the editor, for text processing of patent applications. Roff soon evolved into troff, the first electronic publishing program with full typesetting capability.\n\nAs the system grew in complexity and the research team wanted more users, the need for a manual grew apparent. The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on 3 November 1971; commands were documented in the \"man page\" format that is still used, offering terse reference information about usage as well as bugs in the software, and listing the authors of programs to channel questions to them.\n\nAfter other Bell Labs departments purchased DEC PDP-11s, they also chose to run Unix instead of DEC's own operating system. By Version 4 it was widely used within the laboratory and a Unix Support Group was formed, helping the operating system survive by formalizing its distribution.\n\nIn 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C, contrary to the general notion at the time that an operating system's complexity and sophistication required it to be written in assembly language. The C language appeared as part of Version 2. Thompson and Ritchie were so influential on early Unix that McIlroy estimated that they wrote and debugged about 100,000 lines of code that year, stating that \"[their names] may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed\". Although assembly did not disappear from the man pages until Version 8, the migration to C suggested portability of the software, requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms. Version 4 Unix, however, still had considerable PDP-11-dependent code and was not suitable for porting. The first port to other platform was made five years later (1978) for Interdata 8/32.\n\nThe Unix operating system was first presented formally to the outside world at the 1973 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, where Ritchie and Thompson delivered a paper. This led to requests for the system, but under a 1956 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, the Bell System (the parent organization of Bell Labs) was forbidden from entering any business other than \"common carrier communications services\", and was required to license any patents it had upon request. Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product. Bell Labs instead shipped the system for the cost of media and shipping. Ken Thompson quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disks, each accompanied by – according to legend – a note signed, \"Love, Ken\".",

The franchise has become synonymous with the role-playing game genre and has had a massive impact on the video game industry as a whole.\n\nThe origins of Final Fantasy can be traced back to the early 1980s when Square, a Japanese video game company, was struggling financially. Hironobu Sakaguchi, a young designer at the company, decided to create a role-playing game that he hoped would be his swan song in the video game industry. The game was inspired by the success of the Dragon Quest series and the potential to create a visually stunning game for the new Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nSakaguchi and his team poured their hearts into the development of the game, which they called \"Final Fantasy\" as a reference to the dire financial situation of Square at the time. The game was a massive success, and its popularity helped to save Square from bankruptcy. The release of Final Fantasy in 1987 marked the beginning of a long and successful franchise that has since spanned multiple platforms and has sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\nOver the years, Final Fantasy has continued to evolve and innovate, introducing new gameplay mechanics, storytelling techniques, and visual styles. The franchise has also seen a number of key creative talents, including character designer Yoshitaka Amano, composer Nobuo Uematsu, and producer Hiroyuki Ito, who have all contributed to the unique and enduring appeal of the series.\n\nSquare Enix, the result of a merger between Square and Enix in 2003, has continued to develop and expand the Final Fantasy franchise. The company has released numerous sequels, spin-offs, and remakes, and has also expanded the brand into other media, such as anime, manga, and feature films. The Final Fantasy series has also spawned a massive and devoted fanbase, with dedicated followers of the franchise expressing their passion through fan art, cosplay, and fan fiction.\n\nIn conclusion, Final Fantasy has its origins in the creative vision of Hironobu Sakaguchi and has grown into one of the most beloved and enduring video game franchises of all time. Through the efforts of talented designers, composers, and producers, and the support of a dedicated fanbase, Final Fantasy has continued to evolve and captivate audiences for over 30 years.",

For landlords, it continues to keep their space occupied, and provides a new potential next tenant. Needless to say there are wins all around!",
        "category": "creative_writing",
        "idx": 14,
        "res": "1. Cost-saving: Subleasing a property allows the original tenant to recoup some of their rental costs, while the subtenant may benefit from a lower rental rate compared to the current market value of the property. This cost-saving advantage can be particularly attractive for businesses or individuals looking for a short-term lease or in need of temporary space. For example, a start-up company may not want to commit to a long-term lease, so subleasing a portion of office space from another company can provide them with a cost-effective solution.\n\n2. Flexibility: Subleasing offers both the original tenant and the subtenant flexibility in terms of lease terms and duration. The original tenant can seek a subtenant for the duration of their lease term, allowing them to move out without breaking the lease early. On the other hand, the subtenant may have the option to rent the space for a shorter period of time, which can be beneficial for those who have fluctuating space requirements. This flexibility can also be advantageous in situations where a company needs to scale up or down its operations, as they can easily adjust their space needs through subleasing.\n\n3. Access to desirable locations: Subleasing provides an opportunity for businesses to gain access to prime locations that may otherwise be unaffordable due to high rental rates. For instance, a small retail business may not have the budget to lease a storefront in a popular shopping district, but by subleasing from another retailer, they can take advantage of the foot traffic and exposure that comes with the location without the high costs typically associated with it.\n\n4. Shared resources and amenities: In some cases, subleasing a property may grant the subtenant access to shared resources and amenities, such as conference rooms, parking spaces, or equipment. This can be particularly beneficial for businesses that cannot afford these amenities on their own. For example, a small law firm subleasing space from a larger firm may gain access to shared reception and administrative services, allowing them to present a more professional image to their clients without incurring the full cost of these services.\n\n5. Lease takeover in challenging times: Subleasing offers a solution for tenants facing challenging or uncertain times, such as a downturn in business or the need to relocate. Instead of breaking the lease, the original tenant can seek a subtenant to take over the lease, thus mitigating potential financial losses. Similarly, a subtenant may benefit from taking over a lease with favorable terms in a desirable location that might not be readily available in the current market. This type of arrangement can be a win-win for both parties involved.",

Hong Kong is also a major global financial centre and one of the most developed cities in the world.\n\nHong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nOriginally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages, the territory has become one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports.

Hong Kong is also a major global financial centre and one of the most developed cities in the world.\n\nHong Kong was established as a colony of the British Empire after the Qing Empire ceded Hong Kong Island from Xin'an County at the end of the First Opium War in 1841 then again in 1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. British Hong Kong was occupied by Imperial Japan from 1941 to 1945 during World War II; British administration resumed after the surrender of Japan. The whole territory was transferred to China in 1997. As one of China's two special administrative regions (the other being Macau), Hong Kong maintains separate governing and economic systems from that of mainland China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".\n\nOriginally a sparsely populated area of farming and fishing villages, the territory has become one of the world's most significant financial centres and commercial ports. As of 2021, it is the world's ninth-largest exporter and eight-largest importer. Hong Kong has a market economy characterised by a focus on services, low taxation and free trade; its currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is the eighth most traded currency in the world. Hong Kong is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Asia, and the largest concentration of ultra high-net-worth individuals of any city in the world. Although the city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, severe income inequality exists among the population. Most notably, housing in Hong Kong has been well-documented to experience a chronic persistent shortage; the extremely compact house sizes and the extremely high housing density are the effects of Hong Kong's housing market being the most expensive housing in the world.\n\nHong Kong is a highly developed territory and has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.952, ranking fourth in the world. The city has the largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world, and its residents have some of the highest life expectancies in the world. The dense space has led to a highly developed transportation network with public transport rates exceeding 90%. Hong Kong is ranked 3rd in the Global Financial Centres Index.",

One such legend is the story of Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu. According to Hindu mythology, Holika tried to kill her nephew, Prahlad, by sitting on a pyre with him. However, due to his devotion to Lord Vishnu, Prahlad emerged unharmed while Holika burned to death. This event is celebrated as the victory of good over evil, and on the eve of Holi, bonfires are lit to commemorate the burning of Holika.\n\nAnother popular legend associated with Holi is the love story of Radha and Krishna. According to the legend, young Krishna, who had blue skin, was envious of Radha's fair complexion. His mother, Yashoda, jokingly suggested that he should smear color on Radha's face to make her complexion like his. This playful act of applying colors to each other's faces became a popular tradition, which is why Holi is also known as the \"Festival of Love.\"\n\nThe festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm, during which people of all ages come together to throw colored powders, spray colored water, and engage in merry-making. It is a time to forgive and forget, repair broken relationships, and celebrate the joy of life. Holi also marks the onset of spring, and the vibrant colors used during the celebrations are a reflection of the colorful and joyous season.\n\nHoli is celebrated by Hindus and people from other religious and cultural backgrounds as well. Its popularity has led to widespread celebrations in many parts of the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries with significant Indian diaspora populations.

People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.\n\n2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. \n\n3. Never sell assault rifles to general public. A person who needs to have assault rifles are insecure by nature. They fear that the public is trying to get at them and they need to protect.

There are many DAWs available, such as Ableton Live, FL Studio, and Logic Pro, that offer a variety of tools and instruments for composing electronic music.\n\n2. Experiment with synthesizers and samplers: Synthesizers and samplers are electronic instruments that can be used to create unique sounds and textures for electronic music. You can experiment with different synthesizer presets and create your own sounds by adjusting parameters such as oscillators, filters, and envelopes. Samplers allow you to record and manipulate audio samples to create loops and patterns.\n\n3. Incorporate electronic effects and processing: Electronic music often makes use of various effects and processing techniques to create depth and texture in the sound. You can add effects such as reverb, delay, and distortion to individual tracks or the overall mix to enhance the sounds and create a more dynamic composition. Additionally, you can use processing tools such as equalizers and compressors to adjust the tonal balance and dynamics of your tracks.",

It is the oldest organized sport in North America,[ with its origins with the indigenous people of North America as early as the 12th century.The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.\n\nPlayers use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Both men's and women's field lacrosse have 6v6 versions played on smaller fields, gaining acceptance in multi-sport events. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.\n\nThe modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years.

        "context": "Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in the rule of law, separation of powers, and democratic voting. Political scientists have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government. Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military. States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as \"hybrid democracies\", \"hybrid regimes\" or \"competitive authoritarian\" states.\n\nThe political scientist Juan Linz, in an influential 1964 work, An Authoritarian Regime: Spain, defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:\n\nLimited political pluralism, is realized with constraints on the legislature, political parties and interest groups.\nPolitical legitimacy is based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat \"easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.\"\nMinimal political mobilization, and suppression of anti-regime activities.\nIll-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting extend the power of the executive.\nMinimally defined, an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries that lack civil liberties such as freedom of religion, or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections. Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties, legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent, non-competitive elections. In contexts of democratic backsliding, scholars tend to identify authoritarian political leaders based on certain tactics, such as: politicizing independent institutions, spreading disinformation, aggrandizing executive power, quashing dissent, targeting vulnerable communities, stoking violence, and corrupting elections. Since 1946, the share of authoritarian states in the international political system increased until the mid-1970s but declined from then until the year 2000.",

This means that the same volume of oil weighs less than the same volume of water.\n\nIn addition to its lower density, oil is also immiscible in water, meaning that it does not mix with water. This is due to the polarity of water molecules, which causes them to attract and bond with each other, and repel nonpolar substances like oil.\n\nThe combination of these two factors - lower density and immiscibility - allows oil to float on top of water.

The structure of a Public Forum debate is designed to facilitate a balanced and well-informed discussion of a specific topic. \n\nThe structure of a Public Forum debate typically consists of the following components:\n\n1. Resolution: The debate begins with a resolution, which is a statement of the topic that the debaters are discussing. The resolution is designed to be broad enough to allow for multiple interpretations and perspectives, but specific enough to provide a clear focus for the debate.\n\n2. Team composition: Each debate team consists of two debaters, who take on the roles of \"first speaker\" and \"second speaker.\" The first speaker on each team presents the team's initial arguments, while the second speaker on each team provides rebuttals and further elaboration on the team's position.\n\n3. Opening statements: The first speaker on each team presents an opening statement, in which they outline the main arguments and evidence that they will use to support their position on the resolution. This is also an opportunity for debaters to provide context for the topic and define key terms.\n\n4. Crossfire: After the opening statements, there is usually a period of crossfire, during which the debaters have the opportunity to ask each other questions. This allows for direct engagement between the two teams and provides an opportunity for debaters to challenge each other's arguments and evidence.\n\n5. Rebuttals: Following the crossfire, the second speakers on each team present rebuttals, in which they respond to the arguments and evidence presented by the opposing team. This is a crucial stage in the debate, as it requires debaters to critically analyze and evaluate their opponent's arguments and evidence.\n\n6. Final focus: The debate concludes with final focus speeches from each team, in which the debaters summarize their main arguments and evidence and make their final case to the judges. This is a chance for debaters to reinforce the strength of their position and leave a lasting impression on the judges.\n\nThroughout the debate, debaters are expected to use evidence to support their arguments, and the emphasis is on critical thinking, reasoning, and analysis. Debaters are expected to provide credible and relevant evidence from reliable sources to support their claims and to critically evaluate the evidence and arguments presented by their opponents. The use of evidence is crucial in Public Forum debate, as it demonstrates a debater's ability to engage with complex issues and make informed and persuasive arguments.\n\nOverall, the structure of Public Forum debate is designed to encourage debaters to engage in a rigorous and well-informed discussion of current events and public policy issues, and to develop their skills in critical thinking, research, and persuasive communication.",

This prohibition is based on the interpretation of certain passages in the Talmud and other rabbinic texts, which categorize legumes as \"kitniyot\" (a category of foods that are prohibited for Ashkenazi Jews to eat during Passover).\n\n2. Culturally, the avoidance of peanuts during Passover has become a deeply ingrained custom for many Ashkenazi Jews. While other Jewish communities, such as Sephardic Jews, do not have the same restrictions on legumes during Passover, the Ashkenazi custom has been widely followed and observed for generations.\n\n3. Practically, the prohibition of peanuts during Passover is also a matter of practicality and avoiding potential confusion. Peanuts are often processed in facilities that also handle grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are strictly prohibited during Passover. This can lead to concerns about cross-contamination and the potential presence of forbidden grains in peanuts and peanut products.\n\nIt's important to note that the prohibition of peanuts during Passover is specific to the Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, and not all Jewish communities observe the same dietary restrictions. Additionally, as with many religious customs, interpretations and practices may vary among individuals and communities.",

        "context": "",
        "response": "In order to fly, aircraft need to produce lift. In airplanes, lift is generated by the air that's flowing over the wings. The faster the airplane flies, the more lift is generated. In helicopters on the other hand, lift is generated by the spinning rotor blades. If the helicopter is in motion, the blades will produce more lift on the side where they are moving in the helicopter's direction of travel (advancing), than on the side where they are moving in the opposite direction (retreating). This is called dissymetry of lift. The faster the helicopter flies, the bigger this dissymetry will get. The helicopter's maximum speed is equal to the speed at which the retreating blade would begin to stall.",
        "category": "general_qa",
        "idx": 67,
        "res": "The top speed of a helicopter is limited compared to the speed of an airplane due to several factors:\n\n1. Aerodynamics: Helicopters have a rotor system that creates a significant amount of drag as the blades rotate through the air. This drag limits the top speed of the helicopter as it requires more power to overcome this drag.\n\n2. Power-to-weight ratio: Helicopters typically have a lower power-to-weight ratio compared to airplanes, which means they have limited power available to achieve high speeds.\n\n3. Structural limitations: Helicopter structures are not designed to withstand the high speeds that airplanes are capable of. Pushing a helicopter to high speeds can result in structural failure or other issues.\n\n4. Stability: Helicopters are inherently less stable at high speeds due to their design and rotor system. This can make it difficult to control a helicopter at high speeds, limiting its top speed.\n\nWhile helicopters may not be able to match the top speeds of airplanes, they offer unique capabilities such as vertical takeoff and landing, hover capability, and the ability to operate in confined spaces, making them valuable for certain missions and operations.",

        "context": "",
        "response": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?",
        "category": "open_qa",
        "idx": 80,
        "res": "Many prescriptive grammar rules in English state that it is \"wrong\" to split the infinitive in English sentences, yet modern usage and linguistic analysis indicate that this rule is more of a preference than a hard and fast rule. To understand the rules surrounding infinitive splits, it is necessary to first understand what an infinitive is.\n\nAn infinitive is the base form of a verb, usually preceded by the word \"to.\" In English, infinitives can be split by placing an adverb or other words between \"to\" and the verb. For example, in the sentence \"I need to quickly finish my homework,\" the adverb \"quickly\" splits the infinitive \"to finish.\" Despite traditional grammar rules advising against this, it is generally considered acceptable in modern usage.\n\nThe idea of not splitting infinitives likely comes from attempts to make English grammar more like Latin grammar, as Latin infinitives cannot be split. However, English is not Latin, and attempting to apply Latin grammar rules to English can result in unnatural or awkward sentences.\n\nExample of correct usage: \n- \"I decided to carefully consider all of my options before making a decision.\"\n\nExample of incorrect usage (as per traditional rules):\n- \"I promised to never eat fast food again.\"\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this \"rule\" is more of a guideline, and many modern style guides and linguists do not consider splitting infinitives to be incorrect. In fact, splitting an infinitive can often make a sentence clearer or more natural-sounding.\n\nUltimately, the decision to split an infinitive or not is up to the writer or speaker, and it is more important to prioritize clarity and naturalness in language rather than rigidly adhering to outdated grammar rules.",

        "context": "Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.",
        "response": "Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.  The park is able to support many types of wildlife including Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, mountain goats, free-ranging herds of bison and elk, as well as many types of birds and fish, because of the diversity of habitats.  Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.  Some of the park's most unique features are the geysers and hydrothermal features.  In fact, Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's features like these.

In addition, the forests are also home to a variety of bird species, such as the bald eagle and the osprey.\n\nAnother important environment in Yellowstone is the grasslands and meadows. These open spaces are home to a variety of plant species, including wildflowers and grasses. The grasslands provide important feeding and breeding grounds for many of the park's animals, including bison, pronghorn, and elk. They also provide important habitat for birds such as the sage grouse and the mountain bluebird.\n\nIn addition to forests and grasslands, Yellowstone also features a number of geothermal environments, including geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. These geothermal features are a result of the park's location on top of a supervolcano, and they are some of the most iconic and unique environments in the park. The most famous of these features is Old Faithful, a geyser that erupts regularly and draws millions of visitors each year.\n\nFinally, Yellowstone is also home to a number of aquatic environments, including rivers, lakes, and streams. These waterways provide important habitat for a variety of fish species, including cutthroat trout and grayling. The park's rivers and lakes also provide important breeding and feeding grounds for a variety of bird species, including the trumpeter swan and the bald eagle.\n\nOverall, Yellowstone National Park is home to a diverse range of environments, each of which plays a crucial role in supporting the park's rich and varied wildlife.",

        "response": "Transfer printing is a method of decorating pottery or other materials using an engraved copper or steel plate from which a monochrome print on paper is taken which is then transferred by pressing onto the ceramic piece. Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed.",

The process involves transferring a design from a specially coated paper to the fabric using heat and pressure. \n\nThe following are the steps involved in transfer printing:\n\n1. Design creation: The first step in transfer printing is the creation of a design that needs to be printed on the fabric. This design is usually created using digital software and can be as intricate and colorful as required.\n\n2. Printing onto transfer paper: Once the design is created, it is printed onto transfer paper using special dye sublimation inks. These inks are designed to be heat activated and easily transfer onto fabric.\n\n3. Preparing the fabric: The fabric to be printed on is prepared by being cut to the required size and treated with a special coating that allows the design to adhere properly.\n\n4. Heat transfer: The printed transfer paper is then placed onto the fabric, with the design facing down. Both the paper and fabric are then passed through a heat press machine. The heat and pressure applied cause the dye sublimation inks to transfer from the paper to the fabric, creating a vibrant and long-lasting design.\n\n5. Finishing: Once the transfer is complete, the fabric is allowed to cool before the paper is peeled away, leaving the design transferred onto the fabric. The fabric is then finished according to the specific requirements, such as washing and drying to set the design.\n\nThe materials used in transfer printing include:\n- Transfer paper: This paper is specially coated to hold the dye sublimation inks and transfer the design onto fabric.\n- Dye sublimation inks: These inks are designed to be heat activated and transfer onto fabric easily.\n- Heat press machine: This machine applies heat and pressure to transfer the design from the paper to the fabric.\n- Fabric: Any type of fabric can be used for transfer printing, including polyester, cotton, and blends.\n\nTransfer printing is a popular method for creating custom designs on textiles, as it allows for intricate and colorful designs to be easily transferred onto fabric.",

It differs from paddling sports in that rowing oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks, while paddles are not connected to the boat. Rowing is divided into two disciplines: sculling and sweep rowing. In sculling, each rower holds two oars—one in each hand, while in sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands. There are several boat classes in which athletes may compete, ranging from single sculls, occupied by one person, to shells with eight rowers and a coxswain, called eights. There are a wide variety of course types and formats of racing, but most elite and championship level racing is conducted on calm water courses 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long with several lanes marked using buoys.",

        "res": "Sweep rowing is a type of rowing in which each rower holds a single oar with both hands. It is commonly used in crew teams with an even number of rowers, such as pairs, fours, and eights. In sweep rowing, rowers work in unison to propel the boat forward through the water.\n\nThe technique of sweep rowing involves a coordinated sequence of movements that requires skill, strength, and endurance. Here is a detailed explanation of the technique:\n\n1. Catch: The catch is the beginning of the rowing stroke. The rower places the blade of the oar in the water, with the oar perpendicular to the surface. The rower's body is in a forward position, ready to engage the muscles and pull on the oar.\n\n2. Drive: The drive is the phase where rowers engage their leg, back, and arm muscles to push against the foot stretcher and pull the oar through the water. This propels the boat forward.\n\n3. Finish: As the rower's legs fully extend and the oar is pulled through the water, the rower leans back slightly, using their back and arm muscles to complete the stroke. The oar is then lifted out of the water and returned to the catch position.\n\n4. Recovery: After the finish, the rower allows the oar to skim along the surface of the water as they move their body forward, bending at the knees and preparing for the next stroke.\n\nBenefits of sweep rowing:\n\n1. Full-body workout: Sweep rowing engages the muscles of the legs, core, back, and arms, providing a comprehensive workout for the entire body.\n\n2. Cardiovascular fitness: Rowing is an excellent cardiovascular exercise, helping to improve endurance and stamina.\n\n3. Teamwork: In sweep rowing, rowers must work together in perfect synchronization to achieve maximum efficiency and speed, fostering teamwork and camaraderie.\n\n4. Mental discipline: Rowing requires focus, concentration, and mental discipline to maintain proper technique and rhythm.\n\n5. Low-impact exercise: Rowing is a low-impact sport, making it suitable for individuals of all ages and fitness levels.\n\nOverall, sweep rowing is a challenging and rewarding sport that offers a full-body workout, cardiovascular benefits, and opportunities for teamwork and mental discipline.",

Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time.

First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\n\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).\n\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.",

Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\".\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13× platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n\nOne of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-abortion rights sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency.

So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.  Look around and think about what you can add to your project.  Last and most basic, put a coat of varnish on it to seal it up - and if you choose give it a bit of shine.

When the car pulled behind the grandstands, one teenager fired on a crowd of 300 people with a shotgun, causing seven people to receive injuries. Six of the injured were teenagers, ranged in age from 13 to 19. One received critical injuries. All six received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The shootings occurred at 4:15 PM, and the suspects left the scene. This shooting was the week's second shooting that had high school students involved. The shooting was the second one in a month in which Homecoming activities were involved. Police said that one of the suspects had been involved in a fight on an earlier occasion.\n\nOn April 16, 1987, a student at Murray–Wright entered the school parking lot and shot 17-year-old Chester Jackson, a junior running back, in the head, killing him. The attacker went into the gymnasium and shot 18-year-old Damon Matthews, a basketball player, in the face. Tomeka Turner, an 18-year-old, was wounded. Risen said that Turner's injuries occurred \"apparently in the school's corridors as the attacker fled the building.\" The youth with facial injuries received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital.

        "context": "Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking \n\nO(n) time for each such operation. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array. There are other data structures that support much more efficient insertion and deletion. Binary search can be used to perform exact matching and set membership (determining whether a target value is in a collection of values). There are data structures that support faster exact matching and set membership. However, unlike many other searching schemes, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching, usually performing such matches in \nO(log n) time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves. In addition, there are some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, that can be performed efficiently on a sorted array.\n\nLinear search:\n\nLinear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short, although the array needs to be sorted beforehand. All sorting algorithms based on comparing elements, such as quicksort and merge sort, require at least \nO(nlog n) comparisons in the worst case. Unlike linear search, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching. There are operations such as finding the smallest and largest element that can be done efficiently on a sorted array but not on an unsorted array.\n\nTrees:\n\nBinary search trees are searched using an algorithm similar to binary search.\nA binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can be faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.\n\nHowever, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This even applies to balanced binary search trees, binary search trees that balance their own nodes, because they rarely produce the tree with the fewest possible levels. Except for balanced binary search trees, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching \nn comparisons. Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.\n\nBinary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can be efficiently structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes this method of tree organization. B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.\n\nHashing:\nFor implementing associative arrays, hash tables, a data structure that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records.Most hash table implementations require only amortized constant time on average.However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. Binary search also supports approximate matches. Some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, can be done efficiently on sorted arrays but not on hash tables.\n\nSet membership algorithms:\nA related problem to search is set membership. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A bit array is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of bits, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only \nO(1) time.The Judy1 type of Judy array handles 64-bit keys efficiently.\n\nFor approximate results, Bloom filters, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a set of keys by encoding the keys using a bit array and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with \nk hash functions, membership queries require only \n O(k) time. However, Bloom filters suffer from false positives.\n\nOther data structures:\nThere exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.",

        "res": "The life cycle of a plant can be divided into several distinct stages, each with its own specific characteristics and processes.\n\n1. Germination: This is the first stage of a plant's life cycle, where a seed begins to sprout and grow into a new plant. Germination typically occurs when a seed is provided with the right conditions, such as moisture, warmth, and oxygen. During germination, the seed absorbs water and swells, and the embryo inside the seed begins to grow and push through the seed coat. This ultimately results in the emergence of a young seedling.\n\n2. Growth: After germination, the seedling enters a phase of rapid growth. The plant begins to develop roots, stems, and leaves, and it undergoes photosynthesis to produce its own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. As the plant grows, it may go through different growth phases, such as the vegetative growth phase and the reproductive growth phase. During vegetative growth, the plant focuses on developing its roots, stems, and leaves, while reproductive growth involves the production of flowers, fruits, or seeds.\n\n3. Reproduction: This stage involves the production of flowers, fruits, or seeds, and is crucial for the continuation of the plant species. Many plants rely on pollination to transfer pollen from the male part of the plant (the stamen) to the female part (the pistil), leading to fertilization and the production of seeds. Some plants may also reproduce asexually through methods such as budding, runners, or grafting. The specific methods of reproduction depend on the plant species and their individual characteristics.\n\n4. Death: Like all living organisms, plants eventually reach the end of their life cycle. This may occur after the plant has completed its reproductive stage and produced seeds, or it may be brought about by environmental factors such as extreme weather conditions, disease, or predation. As a plant nears the end of its life cycle, it may stop growing, and its leaves may wither and fall off. Eventually, the plant will die and decompose, providing nutrients for the soil and future plant growth.\n\nThese stages of the plant life cycle are not always linear, as some plants may go through multiple cycles of growth and reproduction before reaching the end of their life cycle. Additionally, the duration and specific characteristics of each stage can vary widely between different plant species.",

        "response": "In the mitochondrion, the matrix is the space within the inner membrane. The word \"matrix\" stems from the fact that this space is viscous, compared to the relatively aqueous cytoplasm. The mitochondrial matrix contains the mitochondrial DNA, ribosomes, soluble enzymes, small organic molecules, nucleotide cofactors, and inorganic ions. The enzymes in the matrix facilitate reactions responsible for the production of ATP, such as the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation of pyruvate, and the beta oxidation of fatty acids.\n\nThe composition of the matrix based on its structures and contents produce an environment that allows the anabolic and catabolic pathways to proceed favorably for. The electron transport chain and enzymes in the matrix play a large role in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The citric acid cycle produces NADH and FADH2 through oxidation that will be reduced in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.\n\nThe cytosolic, intermembrane space, compartment has a water content of 3.8 μL/mg protein, while the mitochondrial matrix 0.8 μL/mg protein. It is not known how mitochondria maintain osmotic balance across the inner mitochondrial membrane, although the membrane contains aquaporins that are believed to be conduits for regulated water transport. Mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 7.8, which is higher than the pH of the intermembrane space of the mitochondria, which is around 7.0–7.4. Mitochondrial DNA was discovered by Nash and Margit in 1963. One to many double stranded mainly circular DNA is present in mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial DNA is 1% of total DNA of a cell. It is rich in guanine and cytosine content. Mitochondria of mammals have 55s ribosomes.",

        "idx": 172,
        "res": "The mitochondrial matrix is the fluid-filled space inside the inner membrane of a mitochondrion, which is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The matrix plays a crucial role in the process of cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\nStructure of the Mitochondrial Matrix:\nThe mitochondrial matrix is enclosed by the inner mitochondrial membrane and contains a variety of enzymes, including those involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), fatty acid oxidation, amino acid metabolism, and the synthesis of certain vitamins. Additionally, the matrix contains mitochondrial DNA, ribosomes, and a small amount of soluble proteins.\n\nFunction in Cellular Respiration:\nDuring the process of cellular respiration, the mitochondrial matrix is where the citric acid cycle occurs. This cycle is a series of chemical reactions that result in the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, a molecule derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The citric acid cycle generates high-energy molecules, such as NADH and FADH2, which are then used in the electron transport chain to produce ATP.\n\nRole of Enzymes and Nutrients:\nSeveral key enzymes are present in the mitochondrial matrix to facilitate the series of reactions that occur during cellular respiration. For example, citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to form citrate, the first step in the citric acid cycle. Other enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase, are also crucial for the cycle to proceed.\n\nIn addition to enzymes, the mitochondrial matrix requires certain nutrients to support cellular respiration. These include acetyl-CoA, which is derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, as well as nutrients like NAD+ and FAD, which serve as electron carriers in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.\n\nUltimately, the mitochondrial matrix is essential for the production of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Through the series of reactions that occur within the matrix, the cell is able to generate the ATP required for various cellular processes, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and biosynthesis. Therefore, the mitochondrial matrix plays a critical role in the overall function and survival of eukaryotic cells.",

        "context": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.",

Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. His campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. He was the first Catholic elected president.\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisors in South Vietnam. He authorized numerous operations to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro, including the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.",

Kennedy played a significant role in shaping American domestic and foreign policy during the Cold War era. Some of his notable contributions include:\n\n1. Cuban Missile Crisis: Kennedy's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 is considered one of his most significant achievements. He successfully negotiated with the Soviet Union to remove nuclear missiles from Cuba, thereby averting a potential nuclear war.\n\n2. Civil Rights: Kennedy was a proponent of civil rights and took steps to advance racial equality in the United States. He supported the desegregation of schools and universities and proposed legislative measures to protect the voting rights of African Americans.\n\n3. Space exploration: Kennedy's famous 1961 speech set the goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade, which led to the Apollo program and eventually the successful moon landing in 1969.\n\n4. Peace Corps: Kennedy established the Peace Corps in 1961, which allowed young Americans to volunteer in developing countries to promote social and economic development.\n\nOverall, JFK is remembered for his charismatic leadership, inspiring speeches, and his efforts to promote equality and peace during a tumultuous time in American history.",

Its total height is 165 m (541 feet), making it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.\n\nIt is located 7.7 km from Terni, a provincial capital of the Italian region of Umbria. \n\nIts source is a portion of the waters of the river Velino. After flowing through Piediluco lake near the community of Marmore (italian), it pours into the valley below formed by the river Nera. The flow of the waterfall depends on an off and on scale with a published schedule to support the power company nearby.\n\nMost of the time, the water in the canals above the Cascata delle Marmore falls is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, so the flow in the falls themselves is heavily reduced. Piediluco Lake, above the falls, is used as a reservoir for the power plant. The Galleto power plant, built in 1929, is architecturally interesting. Its capacity is about 530 MW. To control the operation of the power plant, and to satisfy tourists, the falls are turned on according to a set schedule, achieving a spectacular effect at full flow. An alarm is sounded first, then the gates are opened, and in a few minutes the small stream is transformed into a full-sized river rushing into the void below.\n\nNormally, the falls are turned on between 12:00 and 13:00 and again between 16:00 and 17:00 every day, with additional times on holidays. An entrance fee is charged to visit the falls and the surrounding area.\n\nA path along the falls allows the visitor to hike up to the top of the falls.

Nicknamed \"King James\", he is considered to be one of the greatest basketball players in history and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career assists. He has won four NBA championships (two with the Miami Heat, one each with the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers), and has competed in 10 NBA Finals. He has four MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He has been named an All-Star 19 times, selected to the All-NBA Team 18 times (including 13 First Team selections) and the All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP. James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning two Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 19 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.",

His ability to score, rebound, and facilitate the offense has made him a triple threat and a nightmare for opposing teams to defend.\n\nAdditionally, LeBron's longevity and consistency in maintaining a high level of play over the course of his career have contributed to his status as the greatest of all time. Despite entering the NBA straight out of high school, LeBron has been able to sustain his peak performance for nearly two decades, breaking numerous records and achieving impressive milestones along the way.\n\nMoreover, LeBron's impact on the game extends beyond his individual accomplishments.
